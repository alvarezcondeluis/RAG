## Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF    |  VDC

As of June 30, 2025

## Investment approach

- Seeks to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index.
- Multicapitalization  equity in the consumer staples sector.
- Employs a passively managed, full-replication  strategy when possible.
- If regulatory constraints prevent full replication, the fund uses a sampling strategy to approximate the index's key characteristics. (The fund is currently sampling the index.)
- The fund remains fully invested.
- Low expenses minimize net tracking error.

## About the benchmark

- The MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index includes stocks of U.S. companies within the consumer staples sector.
- The sector is made up of industries that tend to be less sensitive to economic cycles, such as manufacturers and distributors of food, beverages, and tobacco, as well as producers of nondurable household goods and personal products.
- Uses GICS methodology and clearly classified sectors.
- Offers broad representation of the target sector across large-, medium-, and small-cap companies.

The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the most recent month-end, visit our website at vanguard.com/performance  . The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

1. As reported in the most recent prospectus. A fund's current expense ratio may be lower or higher than the figure reported in the prospectus.

2.   Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other figures represent average annual returns. Fund performance figures assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions; the figures are pre-tax and net of expenses. The above widely used comparative index represents unmanaged or average returns on various financial assets that can be compared with the fund's total returns for the purpose of measuring relative performance.

3.   As of 4 p.m., Eastern time, when the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange typically closes.

4.   Effective July 15, 2024, the market price returns are calculated using the official closing price as reported by the ETF's primary exchange. Prior to July 15, 2024, the market price returns were calculated using the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as of the closing time of the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4 p.m., Eastern time). The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

5.   For most recent fiscal year. Turnover rate excludes the value of portfolio securities received or delivered as a result of in-kind purchases or redemptions of the fund's capital shares, including Vanguard ETF Creation Units.

6.   A measure of the volatility of a fund-based on the fund's last three years of monthly returns-used to indicate the dispersion of past returns. A higher standard deviation means a greater potential for volatility. For funds with less than 36 months of performance history, standard deviation is not calculated.

1. Represents the expense ratio for the Vanguard ETF as reported in the most recent prospectus. There are material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are priced continuously and bought and sold throughout the day in the secondary market (at a premium or discount to net asset value) with the assistance of a stockbroker, which entails paying commissions. Sources: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company, and Vanguard, December 31, 2024.

2.  The holdings listed exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.

3.  Sector categories are based on the Global Industry Classification Standard ('GICS'), except for the 'Other' category (if applicable), which includes securities that have not been provided a GICS classification as of the effective reporting period.

Vanguard ETF® shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy or sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

All ETF products are subject to risk, which may result in the loss of principal. Sector ETF products are subject to sector risks and non-diversification  risks, which may result in performance fluctuations that are more extreme than fluctuations in the overall stock market.

The funds or securities referred to herein are not sponsored, endorsed, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI bears no liability with respect to any such funds or securities. The prospectus or the Statement of Additional Information contains a more detailed description of the limited relationship MSCI has with Vanguard and any related funds.
