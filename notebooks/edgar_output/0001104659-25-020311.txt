Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund Investor Shares( VEXMX) Annual Shareholder Report | December 31, 2024 This

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year basis for much
of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal Reserve began
cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of tax cuts and
deregulation under the incoming administration. Each of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors recorded positive
returns for the 12 months. Financials, information technology, and industrials contributed most to the benchmark’s
return. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at

reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares. Cumulative

the period of January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. You can find additional information about the Fund at

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year basis for much
of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal Reserve began
cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of tax cuts and
deregulation under the incoming administration. Each of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors recorded positive
returns for the 12 months. Financials, information technology, and industrials contributed most to the benchmark’s
return. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at

reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares. Cumulative

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year basis for much
of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal Reserve began
cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of tax cuts and
deregulation under the incoming administration. Each of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors recorded positive
returns for the 12 months. Financials, information technology, and industrials contributed most to the benchmark’s
return. How did the Fund perform since inception? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not indicate
how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Mid Cap Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Industrials and financials contributed most to the benchmark’s total return. Other
notable contributors included technology, utility, and consumer discretionary companies. Health care and basic
materials stocks detracted. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past
performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available
on our website at vanguard.com/performance or by calling Vanguard toll-free at 800-662-7447. The graph and returns
shown do not reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares.

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Mid Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a
year-over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July.
The Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Seven of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Industrials, information technology, and consumer discretionary contributed most
to the benchmark’s total return. Health care, consumer staples, energy, and basic materials stocks detracted. How
did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not indicate how
the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at

reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares. Cumulative

Vanguard Mid-Cap Value Index Fund Investor Shares( VMVIX) Annual Shareholder Report | December 31, 2024 This annual
shareholder reportcontains important information about Vanguard Mid-Cap Value Index Fund (the "Fund") for the
period of January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. You can find additional information about the Fund at

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Mid Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a
year-over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July.
The Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Financials, the second-largest sector in the index, was by far the greatest
contributor to results. Other notable contributors included industrials and utilities. Health care and basic
materials stocks detracted. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past
performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available
on our website at vanguard.com/performance or by calling Vanguard toll-free at 800-662-7447. The graph and returns
shown do not reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
roughly in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Mid Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a
year-over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July.
The Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Financials, the second-largest sector in the index, was by far the greatest
contributor to results. Other notable contributors included industrials and utilities. Health care and basic
materials stocks detracted. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past
performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available

shown do not reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares.

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Small Cap Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year
basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal
Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of
tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced expectations
for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors produced
positive returns. Industrial, financial, and technology stocks contributed the most to the benchmark’s return.
Basic materials, the only sector that posted a negative return, was the lone detractor. For the decade ended
December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned about 9%, annualized. How did the
Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not indicate how the Fund
will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at vanguard.com/performance

shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares. Cumulative Performance: December 31,

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Small Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors produced positive returns. Technology, industrial, and consumer discretionary stocks contributed the most
to the benchmark’s return. Real estate, the only sector that posted a negative return, was the lone detractor. For
the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned about 9%,
annualized. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Small Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors produced positive returns. Technology, industrial, and consumer discretionary stocks contributed the most
to the benchmark’s return. Real estate, the only sector that posted a negative return, was the lone detractor. For
the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned about 9%,
annualized. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance does not
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our website at

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Small Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors produced positive returns. Financial and industrial stocks contributed the most to the benchmark’s return.
Consumer discretionary and real estate also performed well. Basic materials, the only sector that posted a negative
return, was the lone detractor. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its
benchmark, which returned nearly 9%, annualized. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that
the Fund's past performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares( VTSMX) Annual Shareholder Report | December 31, 2024 This
annual shareholder reportcontains important information about Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (the "Fund")
for the period of January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. You can find additional information about the Fund at
https://personal1.vanguard.com/ngf-next-gen-form-webapp/fund-literature. You can also request this information by
contacting us at 800-662-7447. The report describes changes to the Fund that occurred during the reporting period.

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Total Market Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted extremely
strong returns and was by far the greatest contributor to results. Consumer discretionary and financials were also
among the top contributors. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past
performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available
on our website at vanguard.com/performance or by calling Vanguard toll-free at 800-662-7447. The graph and returns
shown do not reflect taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or on the sale of fund shares.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Total Market Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted extremely
strong returns and was by far the greatest contributor to results. Consumer discretionary and financials were also
among the top contributors. How did the Fund perform over the past 10 years? Keep in mind that the Fund's past
performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available

How has the Fund changed? The Fund's principal investment strategy disclosure was modified to add that the Fund may
become nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index rebalance or market
movement. The Fund added nondiversification risk and sector risk as principal risks. This is a summary of certain
changes to the Fund since December 31, 2023. For more complete information, you may review the Fund’s next
prospectus, which we expect to be available by April 30, 2025, at https://personal1.vanguard.com/ngf-next-gen-form-

What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Total Market Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted extremely
strong returns and was by far the greatest contributor to results. Consumer discretionary and financials were also
among the top contributors. How did the Fund perform since inception? Keep in mind that the Fund's past performance
does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on our

Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund                                                                                      
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual fund. The fund 
offers five classes of shares: Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, Institutional Shares, and              
Institutional Plus Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements,  
and is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they             
can be purchased and sold through a broker.                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
In March 2023, the board of                                                                                        
trustees approved a plan of reorganization whereby the fund will reorganize from Vanguard Index Funds (such fund   
the "Predecessor Fund”) to a newly created shell series under Vanguard Bond Index Funds. The                       
purpose of the reorganization is to improve administrative efficiencies for all funds within the Vanguard complex  
by spreading the filing and reporting requirements across different legal entities. After the                      
reorganization the surviving fund will be identical in its management to the Predecessor Fund and its investment   
objective, strategies, and policies will remain unchanged. The reorganization is anticipated to qualify            
as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                                  
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.

Small-Cap Index Fund                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December                                                                                        
31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program.                         
                                                                                                                   
8. Other: Dividend                                                                                                 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $4,403,000, representing less than 0.01% of the                   
fund’s net assets and 1.76% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers   
are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                       
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value       
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.            
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,      
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).

Small-Cap Index Fund

Level 3 —Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments. The following table summarizes the market value of the fund's investments and derivatives as of
December 31, 2024, based on the inputs used to value them:

       Includes cumulative appreciation (depreciation) on futures contracts and centrally cleared swaps, if any,

       Only current day’s variation margin is reported within the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.             
                                                                                                                   
D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, and swap agreements were reclassified
between the following accounts:
                                                   
                                           Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment companies;
and the classification of securities for tax purposes. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total
distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the table as follows:

G. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger

accounting policies.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment    
Disclosures. The new guidance did not change how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental
disclosure of information not previously required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in   
business activities, have discrete financial information available, and have their operating results regularly     
reviewed by a chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief   
executive officer, chief investment officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as    
well as the fund’s chief financial officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various          
management committees to assist the CODM with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these     
committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its    
prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and      
making decisions about segment resources, the CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns,      
expense ratios and changes in net assets which are consistent with the information contained in the fund’s         
financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying      
financial statements.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
I. Management has determined that no subsequent events or transactions occurred through the date the financial     
statements were issued that would require recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.                                    
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                        54                                                         
Small-Cap Growth Index Fund                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December                                                                                        
31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program.                         
                                                                                                                   
8. Other: Dividend                                                                                                 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $1,072,000, representing less than 0.01% of the                   
fund’s net assets and 0.43% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers   
are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                       
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value       
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.            
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,      
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Level 3 —Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of 
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments.

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, distributions in connection with fund
share redemptions, and swap agreements were reclassified between the following accounts:
                                                   
                                           Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; and the recognition of unrealized gains or
losses from certain derivative contracts. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total distributable
earnings (loss) are detailed in the table as follows:

G. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies. H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards
Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change
how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental disclosure of information not previously
required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities, have discrete
financial information available, and have their operating results regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief executive officer, chief investment
officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as well as the fund’s chief financial
officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various management committees to assist the CODM
with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s
operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the
fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the
CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns, expense ratios and changes in net assets which are
consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,
and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial statements. I. Management has determined that no
subsequent events or transactions occurred through the date the financial statements were issued that would require
recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

Small-Cap Value Index Fund                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
   Notes to Financial Statements                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index                                                                                     
Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual fund.     
                                                                                                                   
The fund offers four classes of shares:                                                                            
Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, and Institutional Shares. Each of the share classes has different     
eligibility and minimum purchase requirements, and is designed for different types of investors. ETF               
Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased and sold through a broker.                       
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.                                    
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                        80                                                         
Small-Cap Value Index Fund                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December

income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $1,658,000, representing less than 0.01% of the                   
fund’s net assets and 0.66% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers   
are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                       
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value       
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.            
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,      
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Level 3 —Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of 
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments.

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, and swap agreements were reclassified
between the following accounts:
                                                   
                                           Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; and the classification of securities for tax purposes. As of period end, the
tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the table as follows:

G. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies. H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards
Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change
how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental disclosure of information not previously
required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities, have discrete
financial information available, and have their operating results regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief

and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as well as the fund’s chief financial officer      
collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various management committees to assist the                 
CODM with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s 
operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus,                                
through the execution of the fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions 
about segment resources, the CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total                                
returns, expense ratios and changes in net assets which are consistent with the information contained in the fund’s
financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are also detailed in                       
the accompanying financial statements.

funds constituting Vanguard Index Funds, hereafter collectively referred to as the "Funds") as of December 31,     
2024, the related statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, the statements of changes         
in net assets for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes, and the
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2024 (collectively                
referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all        
material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of December 31, 2024, the results of each        
of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in each of their net assets for each of the two years in  
the period ended December 31, 2024 and each of the financial highlights for each of the five years in              
the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial   
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public                         
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the  
Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of              
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
We conducted our audits of                                                                                         
these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of                
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Our audits included performing                                                                                     
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test               
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included        
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating      
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as  
of December 31, 2024 by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and brokers; when replies                
were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a       
reasonable basis for our opinions.

Vanguard Extended Market Index                                                                                     
Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual fund.     
                                                                                                                   
The fund offers six classes of shares:                                                                             
Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, Institutional Shares, Institutional Plus Shares, and Institutional    
Select Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements, and          
is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased
and sold through a broker.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In March 2023, the board of                                                                                        
trustees approved a plan of reorganization whereby the fund will reorganize from Vanguard Index Funds (such fund   
the "Predecessor Fund”) to a newly created shell series under Vanguard Institutional Index Funds.                  
The purpose of the reorganization is to improve administrative efficiencies for all funds within the Vanguard      
complex by spreading the filing and reporting requirements across different legal entities. After the              
reorganization the surviving fund will be identical in its management to the Predecessor Fund and its investment   
objective, strategies, and policies will remain unchanged. The reorganization is anticipated to qualify            
as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                                  
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.                                    
                                                        63                                                         
Extended Market Index Fund                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December                                                                                        
31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program.                         
                                                                                                                   
8. Other: Dividend                                                                                                 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $3,167,000, representing less than 0.01% of the                   
fund’s net assets and 1.27% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers   
are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                       
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value       
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.            
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,      
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).

Level 3 —Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments. The following table summarizes the market value of the fund's investments and derivatives as of
December 31, 2024, based on the inputs used to value them:

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, and swap agreements were reclassified
between the following accounts:
                                                   
                                           Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment companies;
and the classification of securities for tax purposes. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total
distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the table as follows:

Extended Market Index Fund                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
To the extent the fund’s                                                                                           
investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country or asset class, the  
fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to                    
increased price volatility and other risks.                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
The use of derivatives may                                                                                         
expose the fund to various risks. Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small
relative to the notional amount so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A               
relatively small market movement may have a potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities.  
Leveraged derivatives positions can, therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding              
the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific risks associated is described under significant accounting        
policies.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
At December 31, 2024, one                                                                                          
shareholder (VFTC Institutional Extended Market Index Trust) was the record or beneficial owner of 31% of the      
fund’s net assets. If this shareholder were to redeem its investment in the fund, the redemption                   
might result in an increase in the fund’s expense ratio, cause the fund to incur higher transaction costs, or lead 
to the realization of taxable capital gains.                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment    
Disclosures. The new guidance did not change how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental
disclosure of information not previously required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in   
business activities, have discrete financial information available, and have their operating results regularly     
reviewed by a chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief   
executive officer, chief investment officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as    
well as the fund’s chief financial officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various          
management committees to assist the CODM with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these     
committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its    
prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and      
making decisions about segment resources, the CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns,      
expense ratios and changes in net assets which are consistent with the information contained in the fund’s         
financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying      
financial statements.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
I. Management has determined that no subsequent events or transactions occurred through the date the financial     
statements were issued that would require recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund is                                                                                     
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual fund. The fund    
offers five classes of shares: Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, Institutional Shares, and              
Institutional Plus Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements,  
and is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they             
can be purchased and sold through a broker.                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
In March 2023, the board of                                                                                        
trustees approved a plan of reorganization whereby the fund will reorganize from Vanguard Index Funds (such fund   
the "Predecessor Fund”) to a newly created shell series under Vanguard Valley Forge Funds. The                     
purpose of the reorganization is to improve administrative efficiencies for all funds within the Vanguard complex  
by spreading the filing and reporting requirements across different legal entities. After the                      
reorganization the surviving fund will be identical in its management to the Predecessor Fund and its investment   
objective, strategies, and policies will remain unchanged. The reorganization is anticipated to qualify            
as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                                  
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.                                    
                                                        83                                                         
Mid-Cap Index Fund                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December                                                                                        
31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program.                         
                                                                                                                   
8. Other: Dividend                                                                                                 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $4,996,000, representing less than 0.01% of the                   
fund’s net assets and 2.00% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers   
are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                       
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, and swap agreements were reclassified
between the following accounts:

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; and the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment
companies. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the
table as follows:

G. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger

H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment    
Disclosures. The new guidance did not change how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental
disclosure of information not previously required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in   
business activities, have discrete financial information available, and have their operating results regularly     
reviewed by a chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief   
executive officer, chief investment officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as    
well as the fund’s chief financial officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various          
management committees to assist the CODM with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these     
committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its    
prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and      
making decisions about segment resources, the CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns,      
expense ratios and changes in net assets which are consistent with the information contained in the fund’s         
financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying      
financial statements.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
I. Management has determined that no subsequent events or transactions occurred through the date the financial     
statements were issued that would require recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.                 
                                                        87

   Notes to Financial Statements                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index                                                                                      
Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual fund.     
                                                                                                                   
The fund offers three classes of shares:                                                                           
Investor Shares, ETF Shares, and Admiral Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum   
purchase requirements, and is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for                 
trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased and sold through a broker.                                             
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.                                    
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                        98                                                         
Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December

income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $775,000, representing less than 0.01% of the fund’s              
net assets and 0.31% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers are also 
directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value       
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.            
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,      
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Level 3 —Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of 
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments.

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions and swap agreements were reclassified between the following accounts:
                                                   
                                           Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; and the recognition of unrealized gains or
losses from certain derivative contracts. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total distributable
earnings (loss) are detailed in the table as follows:

G. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies. H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards
Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change
how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental disclosure of information not previously
required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities, have discrete
financial information available, and have their operating results regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief executive officer, chief investment
officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as well as the fund’s chief financial
officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various management committees to assist the CODM
with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s
operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the
fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the
CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns, expense ratios and changes in net assets which are
consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,
and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial statements. I. Management has determined that no
subsequent events or transactions occurred through the date the financial statements were issued that would require
recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual fund.     
                                                                                                                   
The fund offers three classes of shares:                                                                           
Investor Shares, ETF Shares, and Admiral Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum   
purchase requirements, and is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for                 
trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased and sold through a broker.                                             
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December

assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.                                    
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                        112                                                        
Mid-Cap Value Index Fund                                                                                           
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December                                                                                        
31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program.                         
                                                                                                                   
8. Other: Dividend                                                                                                 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $863,000, representing less than 0.01% of the fund’s              
net assets and 0.35% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers are also 
directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are   
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value       
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.            
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,      
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Level 3 —Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of 
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments.

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, and swap agreements were reclassified
between the following accounts:
                                                   
                                           Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; and the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment
companies. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the
table as follows:

G. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies. H. The fund adopted Accounting Standards
Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change
how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental disclosure of information not previously
required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities, have discrete
financial information available, and have their operating results regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief executive officer, chief investment
officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as well as the fund’s chief financial
officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various management committees to assist the CODM
with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s
operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its

fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the 
CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns, expense ratios and changes                         
in net assets which are consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment      
assets, liabilities, income, and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial                          
statements.

We have audited the                                                                                                
accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of Vanguard Extended    
Market Index Fund, Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund, Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund and Vanguard Mid-Cap            
Value Index Fund (four of the funds constituting Vanguard Index Funds, hereafter collectively referred to as the   
"Funds") as of December 31, 2024, the related statements of operations for the year ended December 31,             
2024, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024,     
including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended           
December 31, 2024 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial          
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds as of December    
31, 2024, the results of each of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in each of their net assets 
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and each of the financial highlights               
for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Opinions                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
These financial statements are                                                                                     
the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial   
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public                         
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the  
Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of              
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
We conducted our audits of                                                                                         
these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free                   
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.                                                           
                                                                                                                   
Our audits included performing                                                                                     
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test               
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included        
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating      
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as  
of December 31, 2024 by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and brokers; when replies                
were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a       
reasonable basis for our opinions.

Index Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company, or mutual     
fund.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
The fund offers six classes of shares:                                                                             
Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, Institutional Shares, Institutional Plus Shares, and Institutional    
Select Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements, and          
is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased
and sold through a broker.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In March 2023, the board of                                                                                        
trustees approved a plan of reorganization whereby the fund will reorganize from Vanguard Index Funds (such fund   
the "Predecessor Fund”) to a newly created shell series under Vanguard Montgomery Funds. The                       
purpose of the reorganization is to improve administrative efficiencies for all funds within the Vanguard complex  
by spreading the filing and reporting requirements across different legal entities. After the                      
reorganization the surviving fund will be identical in its management to the Predecessor Fund and its investment   
objective, strategies, and policies will remain unchanged. The reorganization is anticipated to qualify            
as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                                  
                                                                                                                   
A. The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.      
investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.           
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation:                                                                                             
Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) on
the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official                     
closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on the      
valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which              
market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the     
fund's pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods                  
deemed by the valuation designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees.        
                                                                                                                   
Investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund                                                                      
are valued at that fund's net asset value.                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
2. Futures Contracts:                                                                                              
The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the 
stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures               
contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby 
simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for                  
liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes
in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts, and the possibility               
of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the   
counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk, the fund trades                
futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and   
has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes initial margin           
requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing       
changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open                    
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments.                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Futures contracts are valued                                                                                       
at their quoted daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of                
Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation       
(depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures        
contracts.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during                      
the period.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
3. Swap Contracts: The                                                                                             
fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or indexes in the
fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the                       
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and 
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a                      
specified period of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares  
of the selected reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a                 
floating rate that is based on short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the    
fund generally invests an amount approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary           
cash investments.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
A risk associated with all                                                                                         
types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to the  
fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on                     
the swap contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of    
prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting                     
arrangements with its counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their
performance. In the absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be                 
repledged, resold, or rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may
terminate any swap contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either                       
party in accordance with its master netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net     
amount owed to the fund under the master netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions               
whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if the fund's net assets decline below a certain level,        
triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net liability position at the time of the termination.        
The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral   
for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The value of collateral received or pledged           
is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each counterparty, and any difference, if in    
excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled within two business days.                   
                                                                                                                   
The notional amounts of swap                                                                                       
contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market      
quotations received from independent pricing services or recognized dealers and the change in value is             
recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments are made or the termination of the swap,            
at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
During the year ended December                                                                                     
31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net assets,  
based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.

Total Stock Market Index Fund                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
4. Federal Income Taxes:                                                                                           
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its      
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until               
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax    
return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state                      
income tax years, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial           
statements.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
5. Distributions:                                                                                                  
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at 
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial             
reporting purposes.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
6. Securities Lending:                                                                                             
To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are  
subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all times by                     
collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations could   
cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When            
this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The 
fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only                 
with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master 
securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements                    
provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans    
with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net                 
amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates     
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the           
securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a      
liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period           
the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market         
appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income           
earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund  
is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities.                                   
                                                                                                                   
7. Credit Facilities and                                                                                           
Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate 
in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit                
agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each   
fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be             
utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing    
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged                   
administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which   
are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included                 
in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either       
facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate,               
the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional   
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based              
upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In accordance with an                                                                                              
exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that 
allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each                              
other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms  
and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment                                  
objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum 
duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to                     
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program.                                     
                                                                                                                   
For the year ended December                                                                                        
31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program.                         
                                                                                                                   
8. Other: Dividend                                                                                                 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair
value of the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from                      
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities
are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment                      
securities are those of the specific securities sold.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Each class of shares has equal                                                                                     
rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related  
to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses),                       
shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares   
based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and                
gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.            
                                                                                                                   
B. In accordance with the terms of a Funds’ Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund, Vanguard  
furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing, and distribution       
services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of operations are allocated to the  
fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and are generally settled twice a month.    
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard,                                                                                      
the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December 31, 2024, the fund had       
contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $48,328,000, representing less than 0.01% of the                  
fund’s net assets and 19.33% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and officers  
are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.

C. Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs are
summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes. The inputs or methodologies used to value
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. Level 1
—Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs (including
quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.). Level 3 —Significant
unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments). Any
investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule of Investments.
The following table summarizes the market value of the fund's investments and derivatives as of December 31, 2024,
based on the inputs used to value them:

D. Permanent differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of net assets are reclassified among capital
accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no effect on net
assets or net asset value per share. As of period end, permanent differences primarily attributable to the
accounting for in-kind redemptions, passive foreign investment companies, and swap agreements were reclassified
between the following accounts:
                                                    
                                            Amount

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment companies;
and the classification of securities for tax purposes. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total
distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the table as follows:

H. Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental ‎disasters, war,
acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global ‎markets and normal market operations.
Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and fund performance. To
the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector, country
or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be subject to
increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies. I. The fund adopted Accounting Standards
Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change
how the fund identifies operating segments but did require incremental disclosure of information not previously
required. Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities, have discrete
financial information available, and have their operating results regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”). The fund is considered a single segment. Vanguard’s chief executive officer, chief investment
officer, and chief financial officer, who are also officers of the fund, as well as the fund’s chief financial
officer collectively act as the CODM. Vanguard has established various management committees to assist the CODM
with overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s
operations to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the
fund’s investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the
CODM relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns, expense ratios and changes in net assets which are
consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,
and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial statements. J. Management has determined that no
subsequent events or transactions occurred through the date the financial statements were issued that would require
recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

   Opinion on the Financial

We have audited the                                                                                                
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the schedule of investments, of Vanguard Total Stock   
Market Index Fund (one of the funds constituting Vanguard Index Funds, referred to hereafter as the                
"Fund") as of December 31, 2024, the related statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, the     
statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024,                
including the related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December  
31, 2024 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial                   
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2024,   
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two           
years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period  
ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United                  
States of America.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Opinion                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
These financial statements are                                                                                     
the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund’s financial   
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public                         
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the  
Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of               
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
We conducted our audits of                                                                                         
these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of                
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Our audits included performing                                                                                     
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test               
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included        
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating      
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as  
of December 31, 2024 by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and brokers; when replies                
were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.
