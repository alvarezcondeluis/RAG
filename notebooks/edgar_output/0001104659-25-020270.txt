What were the Fund costs for the last year? (based on a hypothetical $10,000 investment)

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Information technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted
extremely strong results and was by far the greatest contributor to return. Financials and communication services
were also among the top contributors.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Information technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted
extremely strong results and was by far the greatest contributor to return. Financials and communication services
were also among the top contributors.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Information technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted
extremely strong results and was by far the greatest contributor to return. Financials and communication services
were also among the top contributors.

How has the Fund changed? The Fund’s principal investment strategy disclosure was modified to add that the Fund may
become nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index rebalance or market
movement. The Fund added nondiversification risk and sector risk as principal risks. This is a summary of certain
changes to the Fund since December 31, 2023. For more complete information, you may review the Fund’s next

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-
year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors
recorded positive returns for the 12 months. Information technology, the index’s largest sector by weight, posted
extremely strong results and was by far the greatest contributor to return. Financials and communication services
were also among the top contributors.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Financials, industrials, and technology stocks contributed the most to the
benchmark’s return. Basic materials and health care, the two sectors that posted negative returns, detracted
slightly. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned
about 10%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Financials, industrials, and technology stocks contributed the most to the
benchmark’s return. Basic materials and health care, the two sectors that posted negative returns, detracted
slightly. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned
about 10%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Financials, industrials, and technology stocks contributed the most to the
benchmark’s return. Basic materials and health care, the two sectors that posted negative returns, detracted
slightly. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned
about 10%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Nine of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Financials, industrials, and technology stocks contributed the most to the
benchmark’s return. Basic materials and health care, the two sectors that posted negative returns, detracted
slightly. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed in line with its benchmark, which returned
about 10%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer
discretionary, industrials, and health care also performed well. Consumer staples detracted slightly. For the
decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned nearly 16%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer
discretionary, industrials, and health care also performed well. Consumer staples detracted slightly. For the
decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned nearly 16%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer
discretionary, industrials, and health care also performed well. Consumer staples detracted slightly. For the
decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned nearly 16%, annualized.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-
over-year basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The
Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the
prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced
expectations for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry
sectors posted positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer
discretionary, industrials, and health care also performed well. Consumer staples detracted slightly. For the
decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned nearly 16%, annualized.

in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year
basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal
Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of
tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced expectations
for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors posted
positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer discretionary,
financials, and industrials also performed well. Basic materials, the only sector that produced a negative return,
contributed the least. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned about
13%, annualized.

How has the Fund changed? The Fund’s principal investment strategy disclosure was modified to add that the Fund may

movement. The Fund added nondiversification risk and sector risk as principal risks. This is a summary of certain
changes to the Fund since December 31, 2023. For more complete information, you may review the Fund’s next

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year
basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal
Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of
tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced expectations
for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors posted
positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer discretionary,
financials, and industrials also performed well. Basic materials, the only sector that produced a negative return,
contributed the least. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned about
13%, annualized.

How has the Fund changed? The Fund’s principal investment strategy disclosure was modified to add that the Fund may

movement. The Fund added nondiversification risk and sector risk as principal risks. This is a summary of certain
changes to the Fund since December 31, 2023. For more complete information, you may review the Fund’s next

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Fund performed
in line with its benchmark, the CRSP US Large Cap Index. U.S. economic growth hovered around 3% on a year-over-year
basis for much of the period, and consumer price inflation trended lower, falling below 3% in July. The Federal
Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates in September, which boosted stock returns, as did the prospect of
tax cuts and deregulation under the incoming administration. But near the end of the period, reduced expectations
for further rate cuts weighed on stock returns and bond prices. Ten of the benchmark’s 11 industry sectors posted
positive returns. Technology stocks contributed by far the most to the benchmark’s return. Consumer discretionary,
financials, and industrials also performed well. Basic materials, the only sector that produced a negative return,
contributed the least. For the decade ended December 31, 2024, the Fund tracked its benchmark, which returned about
13%, annualized.

movement. The Fund added nondiversification risk and sector risk as principal risks. This is a summary of certain
changes to the Fund since December 31, 2023. For more complete information, you may review the Fund’s next

500 Index Fund Notes to Financial Statements

Vanguard 500 Index Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company,
or mutual fund. The fund offers four classes of shares: Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, and
Institutional Select Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements,
and is designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on Cboe BZK Exchange, Inc; they
can be purchased and sold through a broker. In March 2023, the board of trustees approved a plan of reorganization
whereby the fund will reorganize from Vanguard Index Funds (such fund the "Predecessor Fund”) to a newly created
shell series under Vanguard Tax-Managed Funds. The purpose of the reorganization is to improve administrative
efficiencies for all funds within the Vanguard complex by spreading the filing and reporting requirements across
different legal entities. After the reorganization the surviving fund will be identical in its management to the
Predecessor Fund and its investment objective, strategies, and policies will remain unchanged. The reorganization
is anticipated to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
                                                                                                                   
  A.  The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.   
      investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.     
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation: Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4
p.m., Eastern time) on the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or
official closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on
the valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market
quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the fund’s
pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods deemed by the valuation
designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees. Investments in Vanguard Market
Liquidity Fund are valued at that fund's net asset value. 2. Futures Contracts: The fund uses index futures
contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the stock market, maintaining
liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures contracts to immediately invest incoming
cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby simulating a fully invested position in
the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of
futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes in market values of stocks held by the fund and the
prices of futures contracts, and the possibility of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is
mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate
counterparty risk, the fund trades futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its
clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The
clearinghouse imposes initial margin requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of
variation margin representing changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial
margin for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. Futures contracts are valued at their quoted
daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as
an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the
contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures contracts. During the year ended
December 31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and
0% of net assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.
3. Swap Contracts: The fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference
stocks or indexes in the fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on
the referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock
and receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a specified period
of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares of the selected
reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a floating rate that is based on
short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the fund generally invests an amount
approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary cash investments. A risk associated with
all types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to
the fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on the swap
contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of prequalified
counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting arrangements with its
counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their performance. In the
absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be repledged, resold, or
rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any swap
contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either party in accordance with its master
netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net amount owed to the fund under the master
netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if
the fund’s net assets decline below a certain level, triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net
liability position at the time of the termination. The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund
has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The
value of collateral received or pledged is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each
counterparty, and any difference, if in excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled
within two business days. The notional amounts of swap contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market quotations received from independent pricing services or
recognized dealers and the change in value is recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset
(liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments
are made or the termination of the swap, at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded. During the year ended
December 31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net
assets, based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.

500 Index Fund

4. Federal Income Taxes: The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute
virtually all of its taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities
until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the
tax return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state income tax years,
and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial statements. 5.
Distributions: Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on
a tax basis at the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for
financial reporting purposes. 6. Securities Lending: To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to
qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are
required to be secured at all times by collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities
loaned. Daily market fluctuations could cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of
the collateral received. When this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market
on the next business day. The fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending
transactions only with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and
entering into master securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending
agreements provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate
any loans with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net amount
owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the securities
loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a liability in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period the securities are on loan.
Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market appreciation or depreciation.
Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income earned on invested cash collateral, less
expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund is entitled to all distributions made on
or in respect of the loaned securities. 7. Credit Facilities and Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain
other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility
provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by
Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any,
under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the
fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the
participating funds are charged administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed
amount of the facility, which are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees
and included in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under
either facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate, the
overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based upon an
alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard. In accordance with an exemptive order (the “Order”) from the
SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that allows registered open-end Vanguard
funds to borrow money from and lend money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending
Program”), subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the
fund’s investment objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but
can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program. For the year ended December 31,
2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program. 8. Other: Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair value of
the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund
and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are bought or sold. Costs used
to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities
sold. Each class of shares has equal rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears
certain class-specific expenses related to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and
Administrative expenses), shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated
to each class of shares based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific
expenses, and gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net
assets.
                                                                                                                   
      In accordance with the terms of a Funds' Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund,        
      Vanguard furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing,         
  B.  and distribution services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of           
      operations are allocated to the fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and   
      are                                                                                                          
      generally settled twice a month.                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard, the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December
31, 2024, the fund had contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $36,173,000, representing less than 0.01%
of the fund’s net assets and 14.47% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and
officers are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund’s custodian bank has agreed to reduce its fees when the fund maintains cash on deposit in the       
  C.  non-interest-bearing custody account. For the year ended December 31, 2024, custodian fee offset             
      arrangements reduced the fund’s expenses by $155,000 (an annual rate of less than 0.01% of average net       
      assets).                                                                                                     
      Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs    
  D.  are summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes.

capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; and the recognition of unrealized gains or

      Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental disasters, war,  
  H.  acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global markets and normal market          
      operations. Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and     
      fund performance.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
To the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector,
country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be
subject to increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies.

overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations
to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s
investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the CODM
relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns, expense ratios and changes in net assets which are
consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,

We have audited the                                                                                                
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the schedule of investments, of Vanguard 500 Index Fund
(one of the funds constituting Vanguard Index Funds, referred to hereafter as the "Fund") as of                    
December 31, 2024, the related statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, the statement of      
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the               
related notes, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2024       
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present         
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2024, the results of its   
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the                 
period ended December 31, 2024 and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December
31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of                       
America.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Opinion                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
These financial statements are                                                                                     
the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund’s financial   
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public                         
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the  
Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of               
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
We conducted our audits of                                                                                         
these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of                
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Our audits included performing                                                                                     
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test               
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included        
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating      
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as  
of December 31, 2024 by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and brokers; when replies                
were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Growth Index Fund Notes to Financial Statements

Vanguard Growth Index Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment
company, or mutual fund. The fund offers four classes of shares: Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, and
Institutional Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements, and is
designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased
and sold through a broker.
                                                                                                                   
  A.  The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.   
      investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.     
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation: Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4
p.m., Eastern time) on the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or
official closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on
the valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market
quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the fund’s
pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods deemed by the valuation
designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees. Investments in Vanguard Market
Liquidity Fund are valued at that fund's net asset value. 2. Foreign Currency: Securities and other assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates obtained from
an independent third party as of the fund’s pricing time on the valuation date. Realized gains (losses) and
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment securities include the effects of changes in exchange rates
since the securities were purchased, combined with the effects of changes in security prices. Fluctuations in the
value of other assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates are recorded as unrealized foreign
currency gains (losses) until the assets or liabilities are settled in cash, at which time they are recorded as
realized foreign currency gains (losses). 3. Futures Contracts: The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited
extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing
transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or
sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index
while maintaining a cash balance for liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are
imperfect correlation between changes in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures
contracts, and the possibility of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a
regulated clearinghouse is the counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk,
the fund trades futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and
clearinghouse, and has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes
initial margin requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin
representing changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. Futures contracts are valued at their quoted daily settlement
prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset
(liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the contracts are
closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures contracts. During the year ended December 31,
2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period. 4. Swap
Contracts: The fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or
indexes in the fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a specified period of
time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares of the selected
reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a floating rate that is based on
short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the fund generally invests an amount
approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary cash investments. A risk associated with
all types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to
the fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on the swap
contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of prequalified
counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting arrangements with its
counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their performance. In the
absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be repledged, resold, or
rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any swap
contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either party in accordance with its master
netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net amount owed to the fund under the master
netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if
the fund’s net assets decline below a certain level, triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net
liability position at the time of the termination. The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund
has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The
value of collateral received or pledged is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each
counterparty, and any difference, if in excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled
within two business days. The notional amounts of swap contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market quotations received from independent pricing services or
recognized dealers and the change in value is recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset
(liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments
are made or the termination of the swap, at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded. During the year ended
December 31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net
assets, based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.

5. Federal Income Taxes: The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute
virtually all of its taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities
until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the
tax return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state income tax years,
and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial statements. 6.
Distributions: Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on
a tax basis at the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for
financial reporting purposes. 7. Securities Lending: To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to
qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are
required to be secured at all times by collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities
loaned. Daily market fluctuations could cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of
the collateral received. When this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market
on the next business day. The fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending
transactions only with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and
entering into master securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending
agreements provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate
any loans with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net amount
owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the securities
loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a liability in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period the securities are on loan.
Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market appreciation or depreciation.
Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income earned on invested cash collateral, less
expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund is entitled to all distributions made on
or in respect of the loaned securities. 8. Credit Facilities and Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain
other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility
provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by
Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any,
under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the
fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the
participating funds are charged administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed
amount of the facility, which are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees
and included in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under
either facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate, the
overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based upon an
alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard. In accordance with an exemptive order (the “Order”) from the
SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that allows registered open-end Vanguard
funds to borrow money from and lend money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending
Program”), subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the
fund’s investment objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but
can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program. For the year ended December 31,
2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program. 9. Other: Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair value of
the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund
and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are bought or sold. Costs used
to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities
sold. Each class of shares has equal rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears
certain class-specific expenses related to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and
Administrative expenses), shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated
to each class of shares based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific
expenses, and gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net
assets.
                                                                                                                   
      In accordance with the terms of a Funds' Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund,        
      Vanguard furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing,         
  B.  and distribution services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of           
      operations are allocated to the fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and   
      are                                                                                                          
      generally settled twice a month.                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard, the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December
31, 2024, the fund had contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $7,417,000, representing less than 0.01% of
the fund’s net assets and 2.97% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and
officers are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund’s custodian bank has agreed to reduce its fees when the fund maintains cash on deposit in the       
  C.  non-interest-bearing custody account. For the year ended December 31, 2024, custodian fee offset             
      arrangements reduced the fund’s expenses by $47,000 (an annual rate of less than 0.01% of average net        
      assets).                                                                                                     
      Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs    
  D.  are summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes.

      Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental disasters, war,  
  H.  acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global markets and normal market          
      operations. Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and     
      fund performance.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
To the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector,
country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be
subject to increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable         
      Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change how the fund identifies operating segments but did      
      require

overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations
to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s
investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the CODM

consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,
and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial statements.

Value Index Fund Notes to Financial Statements

Vanguard Value Index Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment company,
or mutual fund. The fund offers four classes of shares: Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, and
Institutional Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements, and is
designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased
and sold through a broker.
                                                                                                                   
  A.  The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.   
      investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.     
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation: Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4
p.m., Eastern time) on the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or
official closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on
the valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market
quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the fund’s
pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods deemed by the valuation
designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees. Investments in Vanguard Market
Liquidity Fund are valued at that fund's net asset value. 2. Futures Contracts: The fund uses index futures
contracts to a limited extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the stock market, maintaining
liquidity, and minimizing transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures contracts to immediately invest incoming
cash in the market, or sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby simulating a fully invested position in
the underlying index while maintaining a cash balance for liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of
futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes in market values of stocks held by the fund and the
prices of futures contracts, and the possibility of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is
mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate
counterparty risk, the fund trades futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its
clearing brokers and clearinghouse, and has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The
clearinghouse imposes initial margin requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of
variation margin representing changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial
margin for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. Futures contracts are valued at their quoted
daily settlement prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as
an asset (liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the
contracts are closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures contracts. During the year ended
December 31, 2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and
0% of net assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.
3. Swap Contracts: The fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference
stocks or indexes in the fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on
the referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock
and receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a specified period
of time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares of the selected
reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a floating rate that is based on
short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the fund generally invests an amount
approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary cash investments. A risk associated with
all types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to
the fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on the swap
contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of prequalified
counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting arrangements with its
counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their performance. In the
absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be repledged, resold, or
rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any swap
contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either party in accordance with its master
netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net amount owed to the fund under the master
netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if
the fund’s net assets decline below a certain level, triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net
liability position at the time of the termination. The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund
has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The
value of collateral received or pledged is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each
counterparty, and any difference, if in excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled
within two business days. The notional amounts of swap contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market quotations received from independent pricing services or
recognized dealers and the change in value is recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset
(liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments
are made or the termination of the swap, at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded. During the year ended
December 31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net
assets, based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period. 4. Federal Income Taxes:
The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute virtually all of its
taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities until expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax return.
Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state income tax years, and has
concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial statements. 5. Distributions:
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on a tax basis at
the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial reporting
purposes.

6. Securities Lending: To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to qualified institutional
borrowers. Security loans are subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are required to be secured at all
times by collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities loaned. Daily market fluctuations
could cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of the collateral received. When this
occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market on the next business day. The fund
further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending transactions only with a diverse group
of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and entering into master securities lending
agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending agreements provide that, in the event of a
counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any loans with that borrower, determine the
net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net amount owed to the fund; however, such actions may
be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund
may experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in
Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return
of the collateral, during the period the securities are on loan. Collateral investments in Vanguard Market
Liquidity Fund are subject to market appreciation or depreciation. Securities lending income represents fees
charged to borrowers plus income earned on invested cash collateral, less expenses associated with the loan. During
the term of the loan, the fund is entitled to all distributions made on or in respect of the loaned securities. 7.
Credit Facilities and Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain other funds managed by The Vanguard Group
("Vanguard") participate in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to
a credit agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed
annually. Each fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any, under the credit facilities. Borrowings may
be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing
restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the participating funds are charged administrative
fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed amount of the facility, which are allocated to
the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees and included in Management and Administrative
expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under either facility bear interest at an agreed-
upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate, the overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily
Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under
the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based upon an alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard.
In accordance with an exemptive order (the “Order”) from the SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and
borrowing program that allows registered open-end Vanguard funds to borrow money from and lend money to each other
for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending Program”), subject to compliance with the terms and
conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the fund’s investment objective and investment policies.
Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may
be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order
and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the
Interfund Lending Program. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or
the Interfund Lending Program. 8. Other: Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends
included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair value of the securities received. Interest income includes
income distributions received from Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund and is accrued daily. Security transactions are
accounted for on the date securities are bought or sold. Costs used to determine realized gains (losses) on the
sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities sold. Each class of shares has equal rights as
to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears certain class-specific expenses related to
maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and Administrative expenses), shareholder reporting,
and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to each class of shares based on a method
approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific expenses, and gains and losses on investments
are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net assets.
                                                                                                                   
      In accordance with the terms of a Funds' Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund,        
      Vanguard furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing,         
  B.  and distribution services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of           
      operations are allocated to the fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and   
      are                                                                                                          
      generally settled twice a month.                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard, the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December
31, 2024, the fund had contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $5,134,000, representing less than 0.01% of
the fund’s net assets and 2.05% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and
officers are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund’s custodian bank has agreed to reduce its fees when the fund maintains cash on deposit in the       
  C.  non-interest-bearing custody account. For the year ended December 31, 2024, custodian fee offset             
      arrangements reduced the fund’s expenses by $68,000 (an annual rate of less than 0.01% of average net        
      assets).                                                                                                     
      Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs    
  D.  are summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes.                                       
      The inputs or methodologies used to value securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk           
      associated with investing in those securities.                                                               
                                                                                                                   
Level 1 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 —Other significant observable inputs
(including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.). Level 3
—Significant unobservable inputs (including the fund’s own assumptions used to determine the fair value of
investments). Any investments and derivatives valued with significant unobservable inputs are noted on the Schedule
of Investments.

Temporary differences between book-basis and tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) arise when
certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; and the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment
companies. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the

      Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental disasters, war,  
  H.  acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global markets and normal market          
      operations. Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and     
      fund performance.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
To the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector,
country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be
subject to increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable         
      Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change how the fund identifies operating segments but did      
      require

overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations
to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s
investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the CODM

consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,
and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial statements.

Large-Cap Index Fund Notes to Financial Statements

Vanguard Large-Cap Index Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end investment
company, or mutual fund. The fund offers four classes of shares: Investor Shares, ETF Shares, Admiral Shares, and
Institutional Shares. Each of the share classes has different eligibility and minimum purchase requirements, and is
designed for different types of investors. ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca; they can be purchased
and sold through a broker.
                                                                                                                   
  A.  The following significant accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles for U.S.   
      investment companies. The fund consistently follows such policies in preparing its financial statements.     
                                                                                                                   
1. Security Valuation: Securities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4
p.m., Eastern time) on the valuation date. Equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or
official closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades; such securities not traded on
the valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market
quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the fund’s
pricing time but after the close of the securities’ primary markets, are valued by methods deemed by the valuation
designee to represent fair value and subject to oversight by the board of trustees. Investments in Vanguard Market
Liquidity Fund are valued at that fund's net asset value. 2. Foreign Currency: Securities and other assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates obtained from
an independent third party as of the fund’s pricing time on the valuation date. Realized gains (losses) and
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment securities include the effects of changes in exchange rates
since the securities were purchased, combined with the effects of changes in security prices. Fluctuations in the
value of other assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates are recorded as unrealized foreign
currency gains (losses) until the assets or liabilities are settled in cash, at which time they are recorded as
realized foreign currency gains (losses). 3. Futures Contracts: The fund uses index futures contracts to a limited
extent, with the objectives of maintaining full exposure to the stock market, maintaining liquidity, and minimizing
transaction costs. The fund may purchase futures contracts to immediately invest incoming cash in the market, or
sell futures in response to cash outflows, thereby simulating a fully invested position in the underlying index
while maintaining a cash balance for liquidity. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are
imperfect correlation between changes in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures
contracts, and the possibility of an illiquid market. Counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a
regulated clearinghouse is the counterparty instead of the clearing broker. To further mitigate counterparty risk,
the fund trades futures contracts on an exchange, monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and
clearinghouse, and has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers. The clearinghouse imposes
initial margin requirements to secure the fund’s performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin
representing changes in the market value of each contract. Any securities pledged as initial margin for open
contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. Futures contracts are valued at their quoted daily settlement
prices. The notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset
(liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the contracts are
closed, when they are recorded as realized gains (losses) on futures contracts. During the year ended December 31,
2024, the fund’s average investments in long and short futures contracts represented less than 1% and 0% of net
assets, respectively, based on the average of the notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period. 4. Swap
Contracts: The fund has entered into equity swap contracts to earn the total return on selected reference stocks or
indexes in the fund’s target index. Under the terms of the swaps, the fund receives the total return on the
referenced stock (i.e., receiving the increase or paying the decrease in value of the selected reference stock and
receiving the equivalent of any dividends in respect of the selected referenced stock) over a specified period of
time, applied to a notional amount that represents the value of a designated number of shares of the selected
reference stock at the beginning of the equity swap contract. The fund also pays a floating rate that is based on
short-term interest rates, applied to the notional amount. At the same time, the fund generally invests an amount
approximating the notional amount of the swap in high-quality temporary cash investments. A risk associated with
all types of swaps is the possibility that a counterparty may default on its obligation to pay net amounts due to
the fund. The fund’s maximum amount subject to counterparty risk is the unrealized appreciation on the swap
contract. The fund mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into swaps only with a diverse group of prequalified
counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, entering into master netting arrangements with its
counterparties, and requiring its counterparties to transfer collateral as security for their performance. In the
absence of a default, the collateral pledged or received by the fund cannot be repledged, resold, or
rehypothecated. In the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate any swap
contracts with that counterparty, determine the net amount owed by either party in accordance with its master
netting arrangements, and sell or retain any collateral held up to the net amount owed to the fund under the master
netting arrangements. The swap contracts contain provisions whereby a counterparty may terminate open contracts if
the fund’s net assets decline below a certain level, triggering a payment by the fund if the fund is in a net
liability position at the time of the termination. The payment amount would be reduced by any collateral the fund
has pledged. Any securities pledged as collateral for open contracts are noted in the Schedule of Investments. The
value of collateral received or pledged is compared daily to the value of the swap contracts exposure with each
counterparty, and any difference, if in excess of a specified minimum transfer amount, is adjusted and settled
within two business days. The notional amounts of swap contracts are not recorded in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Swaps are valued daily based on market quotations received from independent pricing services or
recognized dealers and the change in value is recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset
(liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until periodic payments
are made or the termination of the swap, at which time realized gain (loss) is recorded. During the year ended
December 31, 2024, the fund’s average amounts of investments in total return swaps represented less than 1% of net
assets, based on the average of notional amounts at each quarter-end during the period.

Large-Cap Index Fund

5. Federal Income Taxes: The fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and distribute
virtually all of its taxable income. The fund’s tax returns are open to examination by the relevant tax authorities
until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the
tax return. Management has analyzed the fund’s tax positions taken for all open federal and state income tax years,
and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the fund’s financial statements. 6.
Distributions: Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are determined on
a tax basis at the fiscal year-end and may differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for
financial reporting purposes. 7. Securities Lending: To earn additional income, the fund lends its securities to
qualified institutional borrowers. Security loans are subject to termination by the fund at any time, and are
required to be secured at all times by collateral in an amount at least equal to the market value of securities
loaned. Daily market fluctuations could cause the value of loaned securities to be more or less than the value of
the collateral received. When this occurs, the collateral is adjusted and settled before the opening of the market
on the next business day. The fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into securities lending
transactions only with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties, monitoring their financial strength, and
entering into master securities lending agreements with its counterparties. The master securities lending
agreements provide that, in the event of a counterparty’s default (including bankruptcy), the fund may terminate
any loans with that borrower, determine the net amount owed, and sell or retain the collateral up to the net amount
owed to the fund; however, such actions may be subject to legal proceedings. While collateral mitigates
counterparty risk, in the event of a default, the fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the securities
loaned. The fund invests cash collateral received in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund, and records a liability in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the return of the collateral, during the period the securities are on loan.
Collateral investments in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund are subject to market appreciation or depreciation.
Securities lending income represents fees charged to borrowers plus income earned on invested cash collateral, less
expenses associated with the loan. During the term of the loan, the fund is entitled to all distributions made on
or in respect of the loaned securities. 8. Credit Facilities and Interfund Lending Program: The fund and certain
other funds managed by The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") participate in a $4.3 billion committed credit facility
provided by a syndicate of lenders pursuant to a credit agreement and an uncommitted credit facility provided by
Vanguard. Both facilities may be renewed annually. Each fund is individually liable for its borrowings, if any,
under the credit facilities. Borrowings may be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes and are subject to the
fund’s regulatory and contractual borrowing restrictions. With respect to the committed credit facility, the
participating funds are charged administrative fees and an annual commitment fee of 0.10% of the undrawn committed
amount of the facility, which are allocated to the funds based on a method approved by the fund’s board of trustees
and included in Management and Administrative expenses on the fund’s Statement of Operations. Any borrowings under
either facility bear interest at an agreed-upon spread plus the higher of the federal funds effective rate, the
overnight bank funding rate, or the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate inclusive of an additional
agreed-upon spread. However, borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility may bear interest based upon an
alternate rate agreed to by the fund and Vanguard. In accordance with an exemptive order (the “Order”) from the
SEC, the fund may participate in a joint lending and borrowing program that allows registered open-end Vanguard
funds to borrow money from and lend money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes (the “Interfund Lending
Program”), subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Order, and to the extent permitted by the
fund’s investment objective and investment policies. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight but
can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one business day’s notice. The interest rate to
be charged is governed by the conditions of the Order and internal procedures adopted by the board of trustees. The
board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the Interfund Lending Program. For the year ended December 31,
2024, the fund did not utilize the credit facilities or the Interfund Lending Program. 9. Other: Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in income, if any, are recorded at the fair value of
the securities received. Interest income includes income distributions received from Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund
and is accrued daily. Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are bought or sold. Costs used
to determine realized gains (losses) on the sale of investment securities are those of the specific securities
sold. Each class of shares has equal rights as to assets and earnings, except that each class separately bears
certain class-specific expenses related to maintenance of shareholder accounts (included in Management and
Administrative expenses), shareholder reporting, and proxy fees. Marketing and distribution expenses are allocated
to each class of shares based on a method approved by the board of trustees. Income, other non-class-specific
expenses, and gains and losses on investments are allocated to each class of shares based on its relative net
assets.
                                                                                                                   
      In accordance with the terms of a Funds' Service Agreement (the “FSA”) between Vanguard and the fund,        
      Vanguard furnishes to the fund investment advisory, corporate management, administrative, marketing,         
  B.  and distribution services at Vanguard’s cost of operations (as defined by the FSA). These costs of           
      operations are allocated to the fund based on methods and guidelines approved by the board of trustees and   
      are                                                                                                          
      generally settled twice a month.                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Upon the request of Vanguard, the fund may invest up to 0.40% of its net assets as capital in Vanguard. At December
31, 2024, the fund had contributed to Vanguard capital in the amount of $1,534,000, representing less than 0.01% of
the fund’s net assets and 0.61% of Vanguard’s capital received pursuant to the FSA. The fund’s trustees and
officers are also directors and employees, respectively, of Vanguard.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund’s custodian bank has agreed to reduce its fees when the fund maintains cash on deposit in the       
  C.  non-interest-bearing custody account. For the year ended December 31, 2024, custodian fee offset             
      arrangements reduced the fund’s expenses by $6,000 (an annual rate of less than 0.01% of average net         
      assets).                                                                                                     
      Various inputs may be used to determine the value of the fund’s investments and derivatives. These inputs    
  D.  are summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes.                                       
      The inputs or methodologies used to value securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk

certain items of income, gain, or loss are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax
purposes; these differences will reverse at some time in the future. The differences are primarily related to
capital loss carryforwards; the deferral of losses from wash sales; the recognition of unrealized gains or losses
from certain derivative contracts; and the recognition of unrealized gains from passive foreign investment
companies. As of period end, the tax-basis components of total distributable earnings (loss) are detailed in the

      Significant market disruptions, such as those caused by pandemics, natural or environmental disasters, war,  
  H.  acts of terrorism, or other events, can adversely affect local and global markets and normal market          
      operations. Any such disruptions could have an adverse impact on the value of the fund’s investments and     
      fund performance.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
To the extent the fund’s investment portfolio reflects concentration in a particular market, industry, sector,
country or asset class, the fund may be adversely affected by the performance of these concentrations and may be
subject to increased price volatility and other risks. The use of derivatives may expose the fund to various risks.
Derivatives can be highly volatile, and any initial investment is generally small relative to the notional amount
so that transactions may be leveraged in terms of market exposure. A relatively small market movement may have a
potentially larger impact on derivatives than on standard securities. Leveraged derivatives positions can,
therefore, increase volatility. Additional information regarding the fund’s use of derivative(s) and the specific
risks associated is described under significant accounting policies.
                                                                                                                   
      The fund adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable         
      Segment Disclosures. The new guidance did not change how the fund identifies operating segments but did      
      require

overseeing aspects of the fund’s daily operations. Through these committees, the CODM manages the fund’s operations
to achieve a single investment objective, as detailed in its prospectus, through the execution of the fund’s
investment strategies. When assessing segment performance and making decisions about segment resources, the CODM
relies on the fund’s portfolio composition, total returns, expense ratios and changes in net assets which are
consistent with the information contained in the fund’s financial statements. Segment assets, liabilities, income,
and expenses are also detailed in the accompanying financial statements.

Fund, Vanguard Value Index Fund and Vanguard Large-Cap Index Fund (three of the funds constituting                 
Vanguard Index Funds, hereafter collectively referred to as the "Funds") as of December 31, 2024, the related      
statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, the statements of changes in net assets for         
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes, and the financial        
highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2024 (collectively referred to as the       
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the    
financial position of each of the Funds as of December 31, 2024, the results of each of their operations           
for the year then ended, the changes in each of their net assets for each of the two years in the period ended     
December 31, 2024 and each of the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended              
December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Opinions                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
These financial statements are                                                                                     
the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Funds’ financial   
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public                         
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the  
Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of              
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
We conducted our audits of                                                                                         
these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of                
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Our audits included performing                                                                                     
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test               
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included        
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating      
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as  
of December 31, 2024 by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and brokers; when replies                
were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a       
reasonable basis for our opinions.
