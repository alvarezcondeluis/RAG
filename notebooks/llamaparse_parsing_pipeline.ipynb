       "The Fund aims to achieve a return on your investment, through a combination of capital growth and income on the Fund‚Äôs assets, which reflects the return of S&P 500 EUR Hedged, the Fund‚Äôs benchmark index (Index).\n",
       "\n",
       "The Index provides a return on the S&P 500 which measures the performance of the large-cap sector (i.e. leading companies with large market capitalisations) of the United States market. Market capitalisation is the share price multiplied by the number of shares issued. Companies are included in the Index based on a free float market capitalisation weighted basis. Free float means that only shares available to international investors, rather than all of a company‚Äôs issued shares, are used to calculate the Index. Free float market capitalisation is the share price of a company multiplied by the number of shares available to international Investors. The Index also uses one month foreign exchange (FX) forward contracts to hedge each non-Euro currency in the Index back to Euro in accordance with the S&P Hedged Indices methodology. Hedging reduces the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the currencies of the equity securities (e.g. shares) that make up the Index and Euro, the base currency of the Fund.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Fund is passively managed and aims to invest in equity securities (e.g. shares) that, so far as possible and practicable, make up the S&P 500, as well as FX forward contracts that, so far as possible and practicable, track the hedging methodology of the Index.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Fund intends to replicate the Index by holding the equity securities which make up the Index, in similar proportions to it. The investment manager may use financial derivative instruments (‚ÄúFDIs‚Äú) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for direct investment purposes to produce a similar return to its Index.\n",

       "The Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties to generate additional income to off-set the costs of the Fund.\n",

You are advised to read it so you can make an informed decision about whether to invest.\\n\\n# iShares S&P 500 EUR Hedged UCITS ETF\\n\\nExchange Traded Fund (ETF) (Acc)\\n\\nISIN: IE00B3ZW0K18\\n\\nManager: BlackRock Asset Management Ireland Limited\\n\\nA sub-fund of iShares V plc\\n\\n# Objectives and Investment Policy\\n\\nThe Fund aims to achieve a return on your investment, through a combination of capital growth and income on the Fund‚Äôs assets, which reflects the return of S&P 500 EUR Hedged, the Fund‚Äôs benchmark index (Index).\\n\\nThe Index provides a return on the S&P 500 which measures the performance of the large-cap sector (i.e. leading companies with large market capitalisations) of the United States market. Market capitalisation is the share price multiplied by the number of shares issued. Companies are included in the Index based on a free float market capitalisation weighted basis. Free float means that only shares available to international investors, rather than all of a company‚Äôs issued shares, are used to calculate the Index. Free float market capitalisation is the share price of a company multiplied by the number of shares available to international Investors. The Index also uses one month foreign exchange (FX) forward contracts to hedge each non-Euro currency in the Index back to Euro in accordance with the S&P Hedged Indices methodology. Hedging reduces the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the currencies of the equity securities (e.g. shares) that make up the Index and Euro, the base currency of the Fund.\\n\\nThe Fund is passively managed and aims to invest in equity securities (e.g. shares) that, so far as possible and practicable, make up the S&P 500, as well as FX forward contracts that, so far as possible and practicable, track the hedging methodology of the Index.\\n\\nThe Fund intends to replicate the Index by holding the equity securities which make up the Index, in similar proportions to it. The investment manager may use financial derivative instruments (‚ÄúFDIs‚Äú) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for direct investment purposes to produce a similar return to its Index.\\n\\nThe Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties to generate additional income to off-set the costs of the Fund.\\n\\nRecommendation: This Fund is suitable for medium to long term investment, though the Fund may also be suitable for shorter term exposure to the Index.\\n\\nYour shares will be accumulating shares (i.e. income will be included in their value).\\n\\nThe Fund‚Äôs base currency is Euro.\\n\\nThe shares are listed on one or more stock exchanges and may be traded in currencies other than their base currency. The performance of your shares may be affected by this currency difference. In normal circumstances, only authorised participants (e.g. select financial institutions) may deal in shares (or interests in shares) directly with the Fund. Other investors can deal in shares (or interests in shares) daily through an intermediary on stock exchange(s) on which the shares are traded.\\n\\nIndicative net asset value is published on relevant stock exchanges websites.\\n\\nFor more information on the Fund, share/unit classes, risks and charges, please see the Fund's prospectus, available on the product pages at www.blackrock.com\\n\\n# Risk and Reward Profile\\n\\n| Lower risk              | Higher risk              |\\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |\\n| Typically lower rewards | Typically higher rewards |\\n\\nThe value of equities and equity-related securities can be affected by daily stock market movements. Other influential factors include political, economic news, company earnings and significant corporate events.\\n\\nParticular risks not adequately captured by the risk indicator include:\\n\\n- Counterparty Risk: The insolvency of any institutions providing services such as safekeeping of assets or acting as counterparty to derivatives or other instruments, may expose the Fund to financial loss.\\n- Currency hedging may not completely eliminate currency risk in the Fund, and may affect the performance of the Fund.\\n\\nThis indicator is based on historical data and may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. The risk category shown is not guaranteed and may change over time. The lowest category does not mean risk free. The Fund is rated six due to the nature of its investments which include the risks listed below. These factors may impact the value of the Fund‚Äôs investments or expose the Fund to losses.\\n\\nThe benchmark is the intellectual property of the index provider. The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by the index provider.

These charges reduce the potential growth of your investment.\\n\\n*Not applicable to secondary market investors. Investors dealing on a stock exchange will pay fees charged by their stock brokers. Such charges are publicly available on exchanges on which the shares are listed and traded, or can be obtained from stock brokers.*\\n\\n*Authorised participants dealing directly with the Fund will pay related transaction costs including, on redemptions, any applicable capital gains tax (CGT) and other taxes on underlying securities.*\\n\\nThe ongoing charges figure is based on the fixed annualised fee charged to the Fund as set out in the Fund‚Äôs prospectus.

      "\n",
      "The Index provides a return on the S&P 500 which measures the performance of the large-cap sector (i.e. leading companies with large market capitalisations) of the United States market. Market capitalisation is the share price multiplied by the number of shares issued. Companies are included in the Index based on a free float market capitalisation weighted basis. Free float means that only shares available to international investors, rather than all of a company‚Äôs issued shares, are used to calculate the Index. Free float market capitalisation is the share price of a company multiplied by the number of shares available to international Investors. The Index also uses one month foreign exchange (FX) forward contracts to hedge each non-Euro currency in the Index back to Euro in accordance with the S&P Hedged Indices methodology. Hedging reduces the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the currencies of the equity securities (e.g. shares) that make up the Index and Euro, the base currency of the Fund.\n",

      "The Fund is passively managed and aims to invest in equity securities (e.g. shares) that, so far as possible and practicable, make up the S&P 500, as well as FX forward contracts that, so far as possible and practicable, track the hedging methodology of the Index.\n",

      "The Fund intends to replicate the Index by holding the equity securities which make up the Index, in similar proportions to it.

The Index provides a return on the S&P 500 which measures the performance of the large-cap sector (i.e. leading companies with large market capitalisations) of the United States market. Market capitalisation is the share price multiplied by the number of shares issued. Companies are included in the Index based on a free float market capitalisation weighted basis. Free float means that only shares available to international investors, rather than all of a company‚Äôs issued shares, are used to calculate the Index. Free float market capitalisation is the share price of a company multiplied by the number of shares available to international Investors. The Index also uses one month foreign exchange (FX) forward contracts to hedge each non-Euro currency in the Index back to Euro in accordance with the S&P Hedged Indices methodology. Hedging reduces the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the currencies of the equity securities (e.g. shares) that make up the Index and Euro, the base currency of the Fund. The Fund is passively managed and aims to invest in equity securities (e.g. shares) that, so far as possible and practicable, make up the S&P 500, as well as FX forward contracts that, so far as possible and practicable, track the hedging methodology of the Index. The Fund intends to replicate the Index by holding the equity securities which make up the Index, in similar proportions to it. The investment manager may use financial derivative instruments (‚ÄúFDIs‚Äú) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for direct investment purposes to produce a similar return to its Index. The Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties to generate additional income to off-set the costs of the Fund. Recommendation: This Fund is suitable for medium to long term investment, though the Fund may also be suitable for shorter term exposure to the Index. Your shares will be accumulating shares (i.e. income will be included in their value). The Fund‚Äôs base currency is Euro. The shares are listed on one or more stock exchanges and may be traded in currencies other than their base currency. The performance of your shares may be affected by this currency difference. In normal circumstances, only authorised participants (e.g. select financial institutions) may deal in shares (or interests in shares) directly with the Fund. Other investors can deal in shares (or interests in shares) daily through an intermediary on stock exchange (s) on which the shares are traded. Indicative net asset value is published on relevant stock exchanges websites.\\nFor more information on the Fund, share/unit classes, risks and charges, please see the Fund's prospectus, available on the product pages at www.blackrock.com\", 'source_document': 'processed_document.pdf', 'chunk_type': 'Text', 'page_number': 1}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",
