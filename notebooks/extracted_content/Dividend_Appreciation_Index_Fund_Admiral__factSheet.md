## Investment objective

Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of common stocks of companies that have a record of increasing dividends over time.

## Investment strategy

The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, which consists of common stocks of companies that have a record of increasing dividends over time. The fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from dividend-paying large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Specific types of stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Index concentration risk: Except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its index, the fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are in the same industry or group of industries. If the index becomes concentrated and the fund needs to concentrate in the same industry or group of industries, its performance could be negatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated.

Nondiversification risk: By tracking its broad-based index, the fund may become nondiversified as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified funds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers than diversified funds, which means their performance may be negatively impacted by relatively few stocks or even a single stock and their shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.

Index replicating risk. The chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.
