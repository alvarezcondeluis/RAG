## Investment objective

Vanguard Explorer Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests mainly in the stocks of small and midsize companies. These companies tend to be unseasoned but are considered by the fund's advisors to have superior growth potential. Also, these companies often provide little or no dividend income. The fund uses multiple investment managers.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small- and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
