## Investment objective

Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund seeks to provide current income while maintaining liquidity and a stable share price of $1.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests solely in high-quality, short-term money market instruments whose interest and principal payments are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's assets will be invested in U.S. Treasury securities and in repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities; the remainder of the assets will be invested in U.S. Treasury securities and in repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The only repurchase agreements that the fund will invest in are those with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that are fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less.

Government money market funds are required to invest at least 99.5% of their total assets in cash, U.S. government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by U.S. government securities or cash (collectively, government securities). The fund generally invests 100% of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities and in repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities and therefore will satisfy the 99.5% requirement for designation as a government money market fund.

Seven-day current yield net of expenses. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotation.

A non-money-market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purpose of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30-day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield. The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

## Plain talk about risk

The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the fund's performance could be hurt by:

Income risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the fund's income is based on short-term interest rates-which can fluctuate significantly over short periods-income risk is expected to be high.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Repurchase agreements risk: The chance that a counterparty to a repurchase agreement may not fulfill its contractual obligations causing the fund to lose money, suffer delays, or incur costs arising from holding or selling the underlying security.

While U.S. Treasury or government agency securities provide substantial protection against credit risk, they do not protect investors against price changes due to changing interest rates. Unlike stocks and bonds, U.S. Treasury bills are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest.

You could lose money by investing in the fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank account and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund's sponsor is not required to reimburse the fund for losses, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time, including during periods of market stress.
