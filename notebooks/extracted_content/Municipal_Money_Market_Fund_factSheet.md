The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the fund's income is based on short-term interest rates-which can fluctuate significantly over short periods-income risk is expected to be high. A low or negative interest rate environment will adversely affect the fund's return. Low or negative interest rates, depending on their duration and severity, could prevent the fund from, among other things, providing a positive yield and/or maintaining a stable share price of $1.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security, including restricted securities, in a timely manner at a desired price.

Credit risk , which is the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Tax risk , which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.

Structured products risk . The fund may invest in structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

Regional risk , which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.

For some investors, a portion of the fund's income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.
