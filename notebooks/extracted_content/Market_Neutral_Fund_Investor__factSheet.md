An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time, and the entire amount invested could be lost. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objective or strategies will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Strategy risk , which is the chance that the fund's investment strategy will not succeed. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to limit exposure to general stock market risk or produce returns that exceed the returns of 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The fund's use of short sales in combination with its long positions in an attempt to improve performance or to reduce overall portfolio risk may not be successful and may result in greater losses or lower positive returns than if the fund held only long positions. When the general stock market is performing strongly, the fund is expected to underperform the market because the fund's short positions will likely lose money. If the fund's market neutral strategy is unsuccessful, the fund may be subject to stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.

Short-selling risk , which is the chance that the fund will lose money in connection with its short sales of securities. Short selling allows an investor to profit from declines in the prices of securities. To engage in a short sale, the fund must 'borrow' securities for a fee. To close out short positions, the fund may have to sell related long positions at disadvantageous times to produce cash to unwind a short position. There is no guarantee that the price of the borrowed securities will decline; in fact, it may rise. The fund's loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited, because there is no upward limit on the price a borrowed security could attain. Short selling involves higher transaction costs than long-only investing, which could offset any gains and increase any losses.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection or strategy execution will cause the fund to fail to achieve its investment objective or to underperform other funds with a similar investment strategy. The advisor's security selection process may not eliminate all stock market risk factors associated with the long and short positions it establishes for the fund. It is possible that the stocks the fund holds long will decline in value at the same time that the stocks it holds short increase in value, thereby increasing potential losses to the fund. Any gain from a short position may be partially or totally offset by a decline in a long position, or vice versa.

Investment risk , which is the chance that the types of securities purchased by the fund will, intentionally or unintentionally, increase the fund's sensitivity to certain investment factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, market capitalization ranges, styles (growth/value), and industries of the underlying securities. These factors may cause the fund to fail to achieve its investment objective of limiting exposure to general stock market risk or cause it to underperform other funds with a similar investment strategy.

Derivatives risk , The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.
