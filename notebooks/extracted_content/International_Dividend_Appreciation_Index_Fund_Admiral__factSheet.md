## Investment objective

Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation Index Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of non-U.S. companies that have a history of increasing dividends.

## Investment strategy

The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the S&amp;P Global Ex-U.S. Dividend Growers Index, which focuses on common stocks of high-quality companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the United States, that have both the ability and the commitment to grow their dividends over time. The fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the collection of securities that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.

## General note

This fund charges a 0.25% purchase fee and a 0.25% redemption fee. Participants may be charged the fees if they execute exchanges, reallocations, and rebalances. Performance data for periods of less than one year does not reflect the deduction of purchase and redemption fees. All other performance data are adjusted for purchase and redemption fees.

* Partial return since fund started, March 2, 2016.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.

Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from dividend-paying stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Dividend-paying stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than the global markets in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.

Index replicating risk, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.

Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the fund's target index (and therefore the fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

Index concentration risk: Except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its index, the fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are in the same industry or group of industries. If the index becomes concentrated and the fund needs to concentrate in the same industry or group of industries, its performance could be negatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated.

Nondiversification risk: By tracking its broad-based index, the fund may become nondiversified as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified funds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers than diversified funds, which means their performance may be negatively impacted by relatively few stocks or even a single stock and their shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.
