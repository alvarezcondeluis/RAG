## Investment objective

Vanguard International Core Stock Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests predominantly in the stocks of companies located outside the United States that its advisor believes offer a good balance between reasonable valuations and attractive growth prospects relative to their peers. The fund is expected to diversify its assets in countries across developed and emerging markets. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's assets will be invested in common stocks of companies located outside the United States. In selecting stocks, the fund's advisor evaluates foreign markets around the world and chooses large- and mid-capitalization companies based on its assessment of each company's management teams, capital allocation, and competitive advantage.

* Partial return since fund started, October 16, 2019.

The fund held a subscription period from October 1, 2019 through October 15, 2019, during which time all assets were held directly or indirectly in money market instruments. Performance measurement began October 16, 2019.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Country/regional risk: The chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Currency risk: The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from non-U.S. mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.

Emerging markets risk: The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.

Special risks of investing in China: The fund's investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund's holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE's market value, which in turn could impact the fund's performance.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
