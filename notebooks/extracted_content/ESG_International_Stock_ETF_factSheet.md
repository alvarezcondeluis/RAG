1. As reported in the most recent prospectus. A fund's current expense ratio may be lower or higher than the figure reported in the prospectus.
2.   Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other figures represent average annual returns. Fund performance figures assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions; the figures are pre-tax and net of expenses. The above widely used comparative index represents unmanaged or average returns on various financial assets that can be compared with the fund's total returns for the purpose of measuring relative performance.

3.   As of 4 p.m., Eastern time, when the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange typically closes.

4.   Effective July 15, 2024, the market price returns are calculated using the official closing price as reported by the ETF's primary exchange. Prior to July 15, 2024, the market price returns were calculated using the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as of the closing time of the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4 p.m., Eastern time). The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

5.   For most recent fiscal year. Turnover rate excludes the value of portfolio securities received or delivered as a result of in-kind purchases or redemptions of the fund's capital shares, including Vanguard ETF Creation Units.

6.   A measure of the volatility of a fund-based on the fund's last three years of monthly returns-used to indicate the dispersion of past returns. A higher standard deviation means a greater potential for volatility. For funds with less than 36 months of performance history, standard deviation is not calculated.

7.   Represents the expense ratio for the Vanguard ETF as reported in the most recent prospectus. There are material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are priced continuously and bought and sold throughout the day in the secondary market (at a premium or discount to net asset value) with the assistance of a stockbroker, which entails paying commissions.

Important Note: The index excludes the stocks of companies that FTSE determines engage in, have a specified level of involvement in, and/or derive threshold amounts of revenue from one or more of the following activities: (i) produce adult entertainment; own/operate adult entertainment establishments; distribute adult entertainment materials; (ii) manufacture alcoholic beverages; supply alcohol-related products/services to alcoholic beverage manufacturers; involved in distribution and/or retail sale of alcoholic beverages; (iii) manufacture tobacco products; supply tobacco related products/services; involved in distribution and/or retail sale of tobacco products; (iv) engage in cannabis cultivation, cannabis distribution, the processing and distribution of cannabis plants, and the creation of cannabis derivative products per the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) standards; (v) own and/or operate a gambling establishment; manufacture specialized equipment used exclusively for gambling; provide supporting products/services to gambling operations; (vi) produce chemical or biological weapons and their components; (vii) produce (or produce specific and critical parts or services for) cluster munitions; (viii) produce (or produce specific and critical parts or services for) anti-personnel mines; (ix) produce nuclear weapons or their components; (x) manufacture military weapons systems and/or integral, tailor-made components of these weapons; provide tailor-made products and/or services that support military weapons; provide non-weapons related tailor-made products and/or services related to the military or defense industry; (xi) produce and sell assault weapons or small arms to civilian customers; produce and sell key components of small arms; involved in the retail and/or distribution of assault weapons or small arms; (xii) involved in the operation and supply of nuclear power generation, that harnesses the energy present within atomic nuclei or their components; engaged in the development, processing, production and distribution of equipment and facilities that are specifically designed for and critical to the generation of nuclear power; (xiii) own proved or probable reserves in coal, oil, or gas; (xiv) any company that FTSE determines per the ICB standards: (a) engages in the exploration for and drilling, production, and supply of crude oil on land or in offshore areas; (b) primarily engages in the refining and marketing of petroleum products; (c) supplies equipment and services to oil fields and offshore platforms; (d) operates pipelines carrying oil, gas or other forms of fuel; (e) engages in all three fields of petroleum production: extraction (upstream), transportation (midstream), and refining and marketing (downstream); or (f) mines, processes and markets coal per the ICB standards; (xv) generate electricity from oil and/or gas, or thermal coal; and (xvi) distribute gas to end users. The level or type of involvement in, or amount of revenue earned from, certain activities or business segments that lead to exclusion by FTSE can vary from one activity or business segment to another. The index methodology also excludes the stocks of companies that, as FTSE determines based on its internal assessment, do not meet certain labor, human rights, environmental, and anti-corruption standards, as well as companies that fail to meet two of the following three diversity criteria: (1) at least one woman on the board; (2) diversity policies in place; and (3) diversity management systems in place. FTSE uses internal methodologies to analyze various factors in determining whether a company meets the foregoing criteria and/or falls within a particular industry, including whether the company has a certain amount of revenue derived from an industry, the company's level of involvement in an industry, and the severity of certain controversies (as determined by FTSE), which can vary from one company to another and from one activity to another.

1.  The holdings listed exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.

Vanguard ETF® shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy or sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

ESG funds are subject to ESG investment risk, which is the chance that the stocks or bonds screened by the index provider or advisor, as applicable, for ESG criteria generally will underperform the market as a whole or, in the aggregate, will trail returns of other funds screened for ESG criteria. The index provider or advisor's assessment of a company, based on the company's level of involvement in a particular industry or their own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or an investor's assessment of such company. As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider or advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider or advisor's proper identification and analysis of ESG data. The advisor may not be successful in assessing and identifying companies that have or will have a positive impact or support a given position. In some circumstances, companies could ultimately have a negative or no impact or support of a given position.

All ETF products are subject to risk, which may result in the loss of principal. Investments  in securities issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.

As of June 30, 2025

Vanguard does not provide any guarantee with respect to the quality, accuracy, or completeness of the information provided by Morningstar, MSCI, or FTSE Russell.

1. Parent Benchmark refers to the broad market index from which the fund's benchmark is derived, prior to the screening of any environmental, social, and governance criteria.
2. Metrics are aligned to the   TCFD's 2021 implementation guidance and the methodology of the   Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)  . Fund scope 1 emissions are calculated by summing the product of the fund's percentage ownership of each investee company's enterprise value including cash (EVIC) by the investee company's Scope 1 emissions, expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Fund scope 2 emissions are calculated by summing the product of the fund's percentage ownership of each investee company's EVIC by the investee company's Scope 2 emissions, expressed in tCO2e. Total carbon footprint is calculated by summing the product of each investee company's weight by the investee company's Scopes 1 &amp; 2 emissions, and dividing the summation by the total market value of the portfolio, expressed in tCO2e per $1 million invested. Weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) is calculated by summing the product of each investee company's weight in the portfolio with that investee company's carbon intensity (derived by dividing the investee company's Scopes 1 &amp; 2 emissions by its revenue), expressed in tCO2e per $1 million in revenue. For more information on the sources of that data and how Vanguard determines its accuracy, see footnote 4 or visit our website at https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/what-we-care-about/pdf/vanguards\_greenhouse\_gas\_emissions\_and\_goals\_methodology.pdf .
3. Coverage is defined as the percentage of eligible securities within our funds and benchmarks for which we have obtained carbon data. The development of carbon metrics is in early stages resulting in challenges in interpreting the data and using it as a basis for investment decision making. For example, the metrics are backward looking and do not recognize future plans to reduce emissions. Carbon metrics may also vary due to being normalized by financial metrics that are prone to market volatility, rather than due to changes to the emissions profile of companies.
4. Vanguard relies on emissions data provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC.  MSCI collects publicly available emissions data from company-reported sources, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and media sources.  Vanguard relies on the accuracy of the data provided by MSCI.  To Vanguard's knowledge, MSCI does not receive third-party assurances regarding the accuracy of the underlying information.  Vanguard does not independently review the accuracy of data published by MSCI nor retain independent third-party verification services to review that data.
5. Certain information © 2025 MSCI ESG Research LLC. Reproduced by permission. These metrics were developed using information from MSCI ESG Research LLC or its affiliates or information providers. Although the Vanguard Group, Inc.'s and Vanguard's information providers including without limitation, MSCI ESG Research LLC and its affiliates (each of the aforementioned parties being the 'ESG Parties'), obtain information (the 'Information') from sources they consider reliable, none of the ESG Parties warrants or guarantees the originality, accuracy and/or completeness, of any data herein and expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties, including those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
