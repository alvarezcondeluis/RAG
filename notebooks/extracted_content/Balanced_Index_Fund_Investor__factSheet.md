## Investment objective

Vanguard Balanced Index Fund seeks-with 60% of its assets-to track the investment performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of the overall U.S. stock market. With 40% of its assets, the fund seeks to track the investment performance of a broad, market-weighted bond index.

## Investment strategy

The fund employs a 'passive management'-or indexing-investment approach designed to track the performance of two benchmark indexes. The fund invests by sampling its target indexes, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximate the full indexes in terms of key characteristics. With 60% of its assets, the fund seeks to track the investment performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which represents nearly 100% of the investable U.S. Stock market covering large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks regulary traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The fund typically holds the largest 1,200-1,300 stocks in the CRSP US Total Market Index and a representative sample of the remainder of the index. With 40% of its assets, the fund seeks to track the investment performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Bond Index, which measures a wide spectrum of public, investment-grade, taxable, fixed income securities in the United States-including government, corporate, and international dollar-denominated bonds, as well as of the bond portion of the fund is invested in bonds through the sampling process. The bond portion of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, all with maturities of more than 1 year. At least 80% held in the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, and all of the fund's bond holdings are selected the fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent with that of the index, which ranges between 5 and 10 years.

The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because stock and bond prices can move in different directions or to different degrees, the fund's bond and short-term investment holdings may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund's stock holdings. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because the fund invests only a portion of its assets in bonds and because the average duration of the fund's bond portfolio is generally intermediate-term. The prices of short- and intermediate-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.

Income risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund holding bonds will experience a decline in income when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds.

Prepayment risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage's principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Extension risk: The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. This will lengthen the duration or average life of those securities and delay a fund's ability to reinvest proceeds at higher interest rates, making a fund more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, there is a chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates.

Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.

Index sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.

Index sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund's target indexes.
