## Investment objective

Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation Fund seeks to provide a tax-efficient return consisting of long-term capital appreciation while tracking the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- and mid-capitalization stocks.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in stocks that pay lower dividends included in the Russell 1000 Index-an index that is made up of the stocks of large- and mid-capitalization U.S. companies. The fund uses statistical methods to sample the index, aiming to minimize taxable dividends while approximating the other characteristics of the index. The expected result is a portfolio that will loosely track the total return performance of the index, but with lower taxable income distributions.

The  fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. Because of the fund's emphasis on low-dividend stocks and its policy of realizing losses to help offset capital gains, its performance will  periodically deviate from that of the Russell 1000 Index. However, over time, this deviation is expected to be relatively modest. The fund's performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more  volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Mid-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility than large-cap  stocks because, among other things, medium-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Indexing risks. The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing. Because the fund does not hold all of the securities included in the index, it is subject to the risk that the  representative sample of securities selected by the advisor will, in the aggregate, vary from the investment profile of the full index. Additionally, the performance of the fund's  investments, in the aggregate, may not match the investment performance of the index. This risk, known as tracking error risk, may be heightened during times of increased market  volatility or under other unusual market conditions. The fund also could be negatively impacted by changes to the index made by the index provider or by errors made by the index  provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders. Index Concentration risk: Except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its index, the fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose  principal business activities are in the same industry or group of industries. If the index becomes concentrated and the fund needs to concentrate in the same industry or group of  industries, its performance could be negatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated. Nondiversification risk: By tracking its broad-based index, the fund may become nondiversified as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an

Tax-managed investing risk is the chance that market conditions or other circumstances may limit the fund's ability to generate tax losses or to generate dividend income taxed at  favorable tax rates. The fund's tax-managed strategy may cause the fund to hold a security in order to achieve more favorable tax-treatment or to sell a security in order to create  tax losses, which may impact returns. Although the fund intends to track the performance of the index, the tracking may fluctuate periodically based on the sampling of the index for  tax efficiency.

index  rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified funds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers than diversified funds, which means their performance  may be negatively impacted by relatively few stocks or even a single stock and their shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.

## Note on frequent trading restrictions

After-tax returns are calculated using the highest individual federal income tax rates in effect at the time of each distribution. They do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Your after-tax return depends on your individual tax situation and, therefore, may differ from the return presented here. If you own fund shares in a taxdeferred account such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, this information does not apply to your investment because these accounts are not subject to current taxes. After-tax returns for Vanguard funds reflect the reduced tax rates on ordinary income, qualified dividend income, and short-term and long-term capital gains that went into effect in 2003. The fund's past performance-whether before or after taxes-does not guarantee future results. If a fund incurs a loss, which generates a tax benefit, the post-liquidation after-tax return may exceed the fund's other return figures. After-tax returns are quarter-end adjusted for fees. After-tax returns for most funds are calculated using the tax liability implied by each fund's declared distributions. However, the exact tax characteristics of many distributions are not known until after the close of the calendar year.
