An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Industry concentration risk , which is the chance that there will be particular problems affecting an entire industry. Any fund that concentrates in a particular industry will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. Because the fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in the common stocks of companies principally engaged in activities in the energy industry, the fund's performance largely depends-for better or for worse-on the overall condition of the energy industry. The energy industry could be adversely affected by energy prices, supply-and-demand for energy resources, and various political, regulatory, and economic factors. Additionally, commodity prices may have a significant impact on the stock prices of energy companies.

Stock market risk , which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Country risk , which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries.

Currency risk , which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Asset concentration risk , which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

Nondiversification risk , which is the chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.
