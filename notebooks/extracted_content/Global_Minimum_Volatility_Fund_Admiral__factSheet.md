## Investment objective

Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation with lower volatility relative to the global equity market.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests primarily in U.S. and foreign stocks that are expected to generate lower volatility relative to the global equity market. The advisor uses quantitative models to evaluate the securities in the fund's benchmark, the FTSE Global All Cap Index (USD hedged), and construct a global equity portfolio that seeks to achieve the lowest amount of expected volatility subject to a set of reasonable constraints designed to foster portfolio diversification and liquidity. The fund will seek to hedge most of its currency exposure back to the U.S. dollar to further reduce overall portfolio volatility.

## Benchmark

FTSE Global All Cap Index Hdg.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk : The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Investment style risk : The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. The fund may emphasize defensive-oriented stocks, which typically lag the stock market during strong market rallies. As a group, non-U.S. stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. The fund also may invest in small and mid-capitalization stocks. Historically, they often perform quite differently as compared to large-cap stocks that dominate the stock market.

Country/regional risk : The chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Currency risk and currency hedging risk : The fund generally will seek to hedge most of its currency exposure back to the U.S. dollar to reduce overall portfolio volatility. However, not all currency exposure will be hedged, so the fund will have a low level of currency risk. Currency risk is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. The fund will also have a low level of currency hedging risk, which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund's foreign currency exposure. For example, the fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar.

Manager risk : The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Counterparty risk : The chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations. Counterparty risk is low for the fund.

Derivatives risk : The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

The Factor Funds are subject to investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which a Factor Fund invests will trail returns from U.S. stock markets.
