## Investment objective

Vanguard Equity Income Fund seeks to provide an above-average level of current income and reasonable long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests mainly in common stocks of medium-size and large companies whose stocks pay above-average levels of dividend income and are considered to have the potential for capital appreciation. In addition, the advisors generally look for companies that they believe are committed to paying dividends consistently. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in stocks, also known as equity securities. The fund's 80% policy may be changed only upon 60 days' notice to investors. The fund uses multiple investment advisors.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization dividend-paying value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Asset concentration risk: The chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks. The fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings.
