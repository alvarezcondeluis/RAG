## Investment objective

Vanguard STAR Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation and income.

## Investment strategy

As a 'fund of funds,' the STAR Fund invests in a diversified group of other Vanguard mutual funds, rather than in individual securities. The fund follows a balanced investment approach by placing 60% to 70% of its assets in common stocks through stock funds and 30% to 40% of its assets in bonds through bond funds. Through its underlying funds, the STAR Fund owns diversified mixes of stocks and bonds. The fund's stock holdings emphasize large-capitalization stocks of domestic companies and, to a lesser extent, a diversified group of stocks in companies located outside the United States. The fund's bond holdings are predominantly fixed income securities such as corporate bonds; U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government and agency securities; and asset-backed, mortgage-backed, and mortgage-related securities.

The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the fund's current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund's overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. In addition to the risks inherent in the asset classes of the underlying funds, the fund also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective. For further details on all risks, please refer to the fund's prospectus.
