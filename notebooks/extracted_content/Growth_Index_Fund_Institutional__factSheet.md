## Investment objective

Vanguard Growth Index Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large-capitalization growth stocks.

## Investment strategy

The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index, a broadly diversified index predominantly made up of growth stocks of large U.S. companies. The fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.

The fund may become nondiversified, as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of the index.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Nondiversification risk. To closely track the composition of the fund's target index, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets. In that case, the fund would be nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, although it would continue to hold approximately 300 stocks across a number of sectors. When the fund is operating as nondiversified, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund's shares may experience more significant fluctuations in value than if the fund was diversified.

Sector risk, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund's assets are invested in the technology sector, the fund's performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.

Index replicating risk, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.
