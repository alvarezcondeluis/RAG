## Investment objective

Vanguard New York Municipal Money Market Fund seeks to provide current income that is exempt from both federal and New York personal income taxes while maintaining a stable net asset value of $1 per share. The fund is intended for New York residents only.

## Investment strategy

Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a variety of high-quality, short-term New York municipal securities whose income is exempt from federal and New York state taxes. To be considered high quality, a security must be determined by Vanguard to present minimal credit risk based in part on a consideration of maturity, portfolio diversification, portfolio liquidity, and credit quality. The fund invests in securities with effective maturities of 397 days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less, and maintains a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less.

Seven-day current yield net of expenses. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotation.

A non-money-market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purpose of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30-day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield. The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

State-specific risk , which is the chance that developments in New York, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by New York and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in New York than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall New York municipal market.

Credit risk , which is the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be very low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the fund's income is based on short-term interest rates-which can fluctuate significantly over short periods-income risk is expected to be high. A low or negative interest rate environment will adversely affect the fund's return. Low or negative interest rates, depending on their duration and severity, could prevent the fund from, among other things, providing a positive yield and/or maintaining a stable share price of $1.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Tax risk , which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.

Structured products risk . The fund may invest in structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

Although the income from a municipal bond fund is exempt from federal tax, you may owe taxes on any capital gains realized through the fund's trading or through your own redemption of shares. For some investors, a portion of the fund's income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.

The fund is only available to retail investors (natural persons). You could lose money by investing in the fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares. An investment in the fund is not a bank account and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund's sponsor is not required to reimburse the fund for losses, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time, including during periods of market stress.
