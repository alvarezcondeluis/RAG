## Investment objective

Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt Fund seeks to provide current income that is exempt from federal personal income taxes, with limited price volatility.

## Investment strategy

The fund has no limitations on the maturity of individual securities, but is expected to maintain a dollar-weighted average nominal maturity of 2 to 6 years. At least 75% of the securities held by the fund are municipal bonds in the top three credit-rating categories (Aaa, Aa, and A for Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or AAA, AA, and A for Standard &amp; Poor's). No more than 20% of the fund's assets may be invested in bonds rated Baa (by Moody's) or BBB (by Standard &amp; Poor's). The remaining 5% may be invested in securities with lower credit ratings or that are unrated.

The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk, but you could still lose money by investing in it. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for limited-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund's monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.

Interest rate risk , which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in short-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of longer-term bonds.

Call risk , which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally low to moderate for limited-term bond funds.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Extension risk , which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally low for limited-term bond funds.

Credit risk , which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. In general, credit risk should be relatively low for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered to be of high quality.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Tax risk , which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.

Derivatives risk . The fund may invest in derivatives and structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

Regional risk , which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.

Although the income from a municipal bond fund is exempt from federal tax, you may owe taxes on any capital gains realized through the fund's trading or through your own redemption of shares. For some investors, a portion of the fund's income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
