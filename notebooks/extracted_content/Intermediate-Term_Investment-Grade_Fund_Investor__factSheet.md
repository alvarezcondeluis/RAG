## Investment objective

Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade Fund seeks to provide a moderate and sustainable level of current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in a variety of high-quality and medium-quality fixed income securities, at least 80% of which will be short- and intermediate-term investment-grade securities. High-quality fixed income securities are those rated the equivalent of A3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or another independent rating agency; medium-quality fixed income securities are those rated the equivalent of Baa1, Baa2, or Baa3 by Moody's, or another independent rating agency.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund's monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.

Interest rate risk , which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Call risk , which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be moderate for the fund.

Extension risk , which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.

Credit risk , which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low to moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered high-quality or medium-quality.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the financial sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.

Derivatives risk . The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
