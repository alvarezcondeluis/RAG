## Investment objective

Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond Fund seeks to provide total return while generating a moderate to high level of current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in fixed income securities of various qualities across several sectors. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in bonds, which include fixed income securities such as corporate bonds, emerging-market bonds, and U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government and agency securities. All bonds purchased by the fund will have a maturity of 90 days or more at the time of their issuance.

The fund invests in fixed income securities of issuers that are tied economically to emerging-market countries. Emerging-market bonds include sovereign debt securities such as fixed income securities that are issued or guaranteed by foreign governments or their agencies, authorities, political subdivisions or instrumentalities, or other supranational agencies, as well as debt securities issued or guaranteed by foreign corporations and foreign financial institutions. The fund may invest in emerging-market bonds of any quality. The fund seeks to have most of its assets denominated in or hedged back to the U.S. dollar but can invest in bonds denominated in a foreign currency on an unhedged basis. The fund may attempt to hedge some or all of its foreign currency exposure, primarily through foreign currency exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage the currency risk associated with investing in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

The fund can purchase bonds of any quality. High-quality fixed income securities are those rated the equivalent of A3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), or another independent rating agency or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality by the fund's advisor. Medium-quality fixed income securities are those rated the equivalent of Baa1, Baa2, or Baa3 or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality. Securities with lower-range credit quality are those rated the equivalent of Ba1 or lower or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality. No more than 65% of the fund's assets may be invested in non-investment-grade fixed income securities, or junk bonds.

In addition to foreign currency exchange forward contracts, the fund may invest in other derivatives, such as options, futures contracts, or other swap agreements.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

Interest rate risk , which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund's income declines when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund's monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.

Call risk , which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Extension risk , which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall.

Credit risk , which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in junk bonds, credit risk should be high for the fund.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Emerging markets risk , which is the chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have more variable economic performance; greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk should be high for the fund.

Country/regional risk , which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.

Currency risk , which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Currency hedging risk, The fund has the ability to invest in foreign bonds which may or may not be denominated in or hedged back to U.S. dollars. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposure. By entering into currency hedging transactions, the fund may eliminate any chance to benefit from favorable fluctuations in relevant currency exchange rates.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Derivatives risk , The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

Counterparty risk , which is the chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract, or other investment vehicle, with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations.

Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
