## Investment objective

Vanguard Explorer Value Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests mainly in the stocks of small and medium-size U.S. companies, choosing stocks considered by an advisor to be undervalued. Undervalued stocks are generally those that are out of favor with investors and are trading at prices that the advisor feels are below average in relation to such measures as cash flow and book value. These stocks often have above-average dividend yields. The fund uses multiple investment advisors.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the financial sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.
