*The index is a subset of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index, which serves as the universe of eligible bonds for use in constructing the index and represents U.S. dollar-denominated, taxable, investment-grade corporate bonds. The index excludes bonds with maturities of less than 1 year and with less than $750 million outstanding, and is screened for certain ESG criteria by the index provider, which is independent of Vanguard.

The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the most recent month-end, visit our website at vanguard.com/performance  . The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

1. As reported in the most recent prospectus. A fund's current expense ratio may be lower or higher than the figure reported in the prospectus.

2.   Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other figures represent average annual returns. Fund performance figures assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions; the figures are pre-tax and net of expenses. The above widely used comparative index represents unmanaged or average returns on various financial assets that can be compared with the fund's total returns for the purpose of measuring relative performance.

3.   As of 4 p.m., Eastern time, when the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange typically closes.

4.   Effective July 15, 2024, the market price returns are calculated using the official closing price as reported by the ETF's primary exchange. Prior to July 15, 2024, the market price returns were calculated using the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as of the closing time of the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4 p.m., Eastern time). The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

5.   Average duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond-and bond mutual fund-prices to interest rate movements. For example, if a bond has a duration of 2 years, its price would fall about 2% when interest rates rose 1 percentage point. On the other hand, the bond's price would rise by about 2% when interest rates fell by 1 percentage point.

6.   Average effective maturity is defined as the average length of time until fixed income securities held by a fund are expected to be repaid, taking into consideration that an action such as a call or refunding may cause some bonds to be repaid before they mature.

7.   For most recent fiscal year. Turnover rate excludes the value of portfolio securities received or delivered as a result of in-kind purchases or redemptions of the fund's capital shares, including Vanguard ETF Creation Units.

8. Represents the expense ratio for the Vanguard ETF as reported in the most recent prospectus. There are material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are priced continuously and bought and sold throughout the day in the secondary market (at a premium or discount to net asset value) with the assistance of a stockbroker, which entails paying commissions.

Important Note: The index excludes the bonds of companies that the index provider determines engage in (which may include manufacturing, owning, and operating), have a specified level of involvement in, and/or derive threshold amounts of revenue from one or more of the following activities: (i) production, distribution, and retail of adult entertainment materials; (ii) production, distribution, retail, and supply of alcohol related products; (iii) involvement in certain gambling related business activities; (iv) production, distribution, retail, supply, and licensing of, tobacco related products; (v) manufacture of nuclear weapons or key nuclear weapons components; (vi) manufacture of biological and chemical weapons or key biological and chemical weapons components; cluster munitions whole weapons systems, components, or delivery platforms; landmines whole systems or components; or involvement in the production of depleted uranium (DU) weapons, ammunition, and armor; (vii) production of conventional weapons and components or involvement with conventional weapons support systems and services; (viii) production and/or distribution (wholesale or retail) of firearms or small arms ammunition intended for civilian use (companies that cater to the military, government, and law enforcement markets are not included in the foregoing); (ix) ownership or operation of nuclear power plants or active uranium mines; involvement in uranium enrichment and processing; involvement in the design and engineering of nuclear power reactors; or supplying nuclear power activities; and (x) have an industry tie to fossil fuels (thermal coal, oil and gas), in particular, reserve ownership, related revenues and power generation (companies providing evidence of owning metallurgical coal reserves are not included in the foregoing). The level or type of involvement in, or amount of revenue earned from, certain activities or business segments that lead to exclusion by the index provider can vary from one activity or business segment to another. In addition, the index methodology excludes the bonds of companies that, as determined by the index provider, do not meet certain standards defined by the index provider with respect to an ESG controversies assessment or do not have an ESG controversy assessment score. The ESG controversies assessment measures a company's involvement in major ESG controversies and how well they adhere to international norms and principles. Where MSCI, the index provider's data source, has insufficient or no data available to adequately assess a particular issuer relative to the ESG criteria of the index, bonds of such issuer may be excluded from the index until such time as they may be determined to be eligible by MSCI. Additionally, the index excludes bonds of companies that fail to have at least one woman on their board of directors and companies for which the index provider does not have board diversity data. The screens for ESG criteria described above do not apply to government-issued bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury securities), asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities.

1.  Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.

Vanguard ETF® shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy or sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

ESG funds are subject to ESG investment risk, which is the chance that the stocks or bonds screened by the index provider or advisor, as applicable, for ESG criteria generally will underperform the market as a whole or, in the aggregate, will trail returns of other funds screened for ESG criteria. The index provider or advisor's assessment of a company, based on the company's level of involvement in a particular industry or their own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or an investor's assessment of such company. As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider or advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider or advisor's proper identification and analysis of ESG data. The advisor may not be successful in assessing and identifying companies that have or will have a positive impact or support a given position. In some circumstances, companies could ultimately have a negative or no impact or support of a given position.

All ETF products are subject to risk, which may result in the loss of principal. Investments  in bond ETF products are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.

As of June 30, 2025

Vanguard does not provide any guarantee with respect to the quality, accuracy, or completeness of the information provided by Morningstar, MSCI, or FTSE Russell.

1. Parent Benchmark refers to the broad market index from which the fund's benchmark is derived, prior to the screening of any environmental, social, and governance criteria.
2. Metrics are aligned to the   TCFD's 2021 implementation guidance and the methodology of the   Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)  . Fund scope 1 emissions are calculated by summing the product of the fund's percentage ownership of each investee company's enterprise value including cash (EVIC) by the investee company's Scope 1 emissions, expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Fund scope 2 emissions are calculated by summing the product of the fund's percentage ownership of each investee company's EVIC by the investee company's Scope 2 emissions, expressed in tCO2e. Total carbon footprint is calculated by summing the product of each investee company's weight by the investee company's Scopes 1 &amp; 2 emissions, and dividing the summation by the total market value of the portfolio, expressed in tCO2e per $1 million invested. Weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) is calculated by summing the product of each investee company's weight in the portfolio with that investee company's carbon intensity (derived by dividing the investee company's Scopes 1 &amp; 2 emissions by its revenue), expressed in tCO2e per $1 million in revenue. For more information on the sources of that data and how Vanguard determines its accuracy, see footnote 4 or visit our website at
3. https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/what-we-care-about/pdf/vanguards\_greenhouse\_gas\_emissions\_and\_goals\_methodology.pdf .
3. Coverage is defined as the percentage of eligible securities within our funds and benchmarks for which we have obtained carbon data. The development of carbon metrics is in early stages resulting in challenges in interpreting the data and using it as a basis for investment decision making. For example, the metrics are backward looking and do not recognize future plans to reduce emissions. Carbon metrics may also vary due to being normalized by financial metrics that are prone to market volatility, rather than due to changes to the emissions profile of companies.
4. Vanguard relies on emissions data provided by MSCI ESG Research LLC.  MSCI collects publicly available emissions data from company-reported sources, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and media sources.  Vanguard relies on the accuracy of the data provided by MSCI.  To Vanguard's knowledge, MSCI does not receive third-party assurances regarding the accuracy of the underlying information.  Vanguard does not independently review the accuracy of data published by MSCI nor retain independent third-party verification services to review that data.
