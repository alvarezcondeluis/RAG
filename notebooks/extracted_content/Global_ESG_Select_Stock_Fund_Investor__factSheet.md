## Investment objective

Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund seeks to maximize returns while having greater exposure to companies with attractive environmental, social, and governance characteristics.

## Investment strategy

Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's assets will be invested in common stocks of companies that meet the advisor's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. The fund will typically invest in stocks of large and mid-size companies located in a number of countries throughout the world, including issuers located in emerging markets. The fund's investment approach is based on proprietary, bottom-up fundamental research conducted by the advisor. The advisor considers the investment universe, sector-by-sector and region-by-region, looking for companies with strong long-term fundamentals with an emphasis on the following company attributes: (1) a proven track record of effective capital allocation, (2) leading ESG practices (e.g., increased transparency into the company's ESG practices, board diversity, management teams with aligned incentives, better governance practices, and realistic assessment of long-term ESG risks and opportunities), and (3) confidence that a wide gap between return on capital and cost of capital can be sustained. The advisor will then examine issues outside the scope of traditional research-such as corporate culture, adaptability, and employee engagement-to build conviction in each holding.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

ESG investing risks: The fund is subject to ESG investing risks. The fund's advisor selects securities for the fund based on the ESG criteria disclosed in the fund's principal investment strategies. Using ESG criteria could result in the fund investing in securities that trail the returns of other funds that use ESG criteria or in the fund underperforming the market as a whole. Interpretations of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics can - and do - vary significantly across individuals, index providers, advisors, and other funds that use ESG criteria. As a result, the fund's disclosed ESG criteria, or the advisor's assessment of whether or not a company or issuer meets the fund's disclosed ESG criteria, may not align with your personal view of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics. Further, individual securities held by the fund may not reflect your personal preferences, beliefs, expectations, and/or values. In order to assess a company or issuer against the fund's disclosed ESG criteria, the advisor depends on the availability of data obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. There can be no assurance that this data will be accurate, complete, or current, which could result in an inaccurate assessment of a company or issuer.

Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.
