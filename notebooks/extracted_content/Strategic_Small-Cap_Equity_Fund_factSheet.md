## Investment objective

Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in small-capitalization domestic equity securities based on the advisor's assessment of the relative return potential of the securities. The advisor selects securities that it believes offer an appropriate balance between strong growth prospects and reasonable valuations relative to their industry peers. The advisor does this by using a quantitative process to evaluate all of the securities in the fund's benchmark, the MSCI US Small Cap 1750 Index, while seeking to maintain a risk profile similar to that of the index. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund's assets will be invested in small-cap equity securities.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk , which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.

Investment style risk , which is the chance that returns from the small-capitalization stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. The stock prices of small companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. The fund's advisor uses a quantitative process to evaluate securities and the fund can perform differently from the market as a whole as a result of the stock selection model.
