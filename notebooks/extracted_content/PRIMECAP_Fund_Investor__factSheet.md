## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk , which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.

Asset concentration risk , which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

Investment style risk , which is the chance that returns from large- and mid-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large- and mid-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investments in the health care and information technology sectors subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of these sectors.
