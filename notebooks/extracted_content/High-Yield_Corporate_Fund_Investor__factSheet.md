## Investment objective

Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund seeks to provide a high level of current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests mainly in a diversified group of high-yielding, higher-risk corporate bonds-commonly known as 'junk bonds'-with medium- and lower-range credit-quality ratings. The fund invests at least 80% of its assets in corporate bonds that are rated below Baa by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; have an equivalent rating by any other independent bond-rating agency; or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality by the fund's advisors. The fund's 80% policy may be changed only upon 60 days' notice to investors. The fund may not invest more than 20% of its assets in any of the following, taken as a whole: bonds with credit ratings lower than B or the equivalent, convertible securities, and preferred stocks.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

Credit risk , which is the chance that a bond or loan issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond or loan to decline. Credit risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in junk bonds.

Call risk , which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be high for the fund because of the high percentage of callable bonds.

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate to high for the fund, so investors should expect the fund's monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.

Interest rate risk , which is the chance that bond or loan prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Extension risk , which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk should be low to moderate for the fund.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
