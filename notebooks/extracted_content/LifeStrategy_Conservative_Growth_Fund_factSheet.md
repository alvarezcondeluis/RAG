## Investment objective

Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Fund seeks to provide current income and low to moderate capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in a mix of Vanguard mutual funds according to an asset-allocation strategy that reflects an allocation of approximately 59% of the fund's assets to fixed-income securities and 41% to common stocks. The targeted percentage of the fund's assets allocated to the underlying asset classes is: U.S fixed-income securities 41.5%, U.S stocks 25.0%, Foreign fixed-income securities 17.5%, Foreign stocks 16.0%.

The fund's indirect fixed-income holdings are a diversified mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government, agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize foreign currency exposure). The fund's indirect stock holdings are a diversified mix of U.S. and foreign large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks.

The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the fund's current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund's overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. In addition to the risks inherent in the asset classes of the underlying funds, the fund also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective. For further details on all risks, please refer to the fund's prospectus.
