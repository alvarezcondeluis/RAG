## Investment objective

Vanguard Institutional Total Stock Market Index Trust seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of the overall stock market.

## Investment strategy

The trust portfolio currently invests all its assets in Institutional Select shares of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund which employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which represents approximately 100% of the investable U.S. stock market and includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key characteristics. These key characteristics include industry weightings and market capitalization, as well as certain financial measures, such as price/earnings ratio and dividend yield.

An investment in the trust could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the trust's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The trust's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The trust's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.

Index sampling risk : The chance that the securities selected, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk should be low.

Sector risk: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the trust's assets are in the information technology sector, the trust's performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.

Nondiversification risk: Because the trust seeks to closely track the composition of the target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the trust's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the trust's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement. As a result, the trust's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the trust's shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.

Index-related risks: The trust is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the trust's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the trust's performance. Because the trust seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the trust's performance may be lower than it would be if the trust were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the trust's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the trust will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the trust and, as a result, the trust's shareholders.
