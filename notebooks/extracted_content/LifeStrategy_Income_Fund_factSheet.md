## Investment objective

Vanguard LifeStrategy Income Fund seeks to provide current income and some capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in other Vanguard mutual funds according to a fixed formula that reflects an allocation of approximately 80% of the fund's assets to bonds and 20% to common stocks. The targeted percentage of the fund's assets allocated to each of the underlying funds is: Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund 56%, Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund/Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund 24%, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund 12%, and Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund 8%.

The fund's indirect bond holdings are a diversified mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government, agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize currency exposures). The fund's indirect stock holdings are a diversified mix of U.S. and foreign large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks.

The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the fund's current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund's overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. In addition to the risks inherent in the asset classes of the underlying funds, the fund also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective. For further details on all risks, please refer to the fund's prospectus.
