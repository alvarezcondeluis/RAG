## Investment objective

Vanguard Wellington Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation and reasonable current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests 60% to 70% of its assets in dividend-paying, and, to a lesser extent, non-dividend-paying common stocks of established medium-size and large companies. In choosing these companies, the advisor seeks those that appear to be undervalued but to have prospects for improvement. These stocks are commonly referred to as value stocks. The remaining 30% to 40% of fund assets are invested mainly in investment-grade corporate bonds, with some exposure to U.S. Treasury and government agency bonds, as well as mortgage-backed securities.

## Plain talk about risk

The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because stock and bond prices can move in different directions or to different degrees, the fund's bond and short-term investment holdings may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund's stock holdings. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Mid-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility than large-cap stocks because, among other things, medium-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.

Income risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.

Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.

Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
