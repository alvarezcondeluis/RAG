## Investment objective

Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund seeks to provide current income and some capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in other Vanguard mutual funds according to an asset allocation strategy designed for investors currently in retirement. The underlying funds are: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund.

The fund's indirect bond holdings are a diversified mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; inflation-protected public obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government, agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize foreign currency exposure). The fund's indirect stock holdings are a diversified mix of U.S. and foreign large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying Vanguard funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying Vanguard funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. As the underlying funds invest in stocks and bonds the fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the fund's current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund's overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. The fund also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective. For further details on all risks, please refer to the fund's prospectus.
