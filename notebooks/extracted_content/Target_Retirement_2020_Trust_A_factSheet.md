## Investment objective

Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Trust seeks to provide capital appreciation and current income consistent with its current asset allocation.

## Investment strategy

The trust invests in other Vanguard mutual funds and trusts according to an asset allocation strategy designed for investors planning to retire and leave the workforce in or within a few years of 2020 (the target year). The trust's asset allocation will become more conservative over time, meaning that the percentage of assets allocated to stocks will decrease while the percentage of assets allocated to bonds and other fixed income investments will increase. Within seven years after 2020, the trust's asset allocation should resemble that of the Target Retirement Income Trust. The underlying holdings are: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Vanguard Institutional Total International Stock Market Index Trust II, Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Fund.

The trust's indirect bond holdings are a diversified mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; inflation-protected public obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government, agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize foreign currency exposure). The trust's indirect stock holdings are a diversified mix of U.S. and foreign large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

Because the trust invests substantially all of its assets in underlying Vanguard funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk.  This means that the trust is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying Vanguard funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. The trust is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the trust's current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the trust's overall level of risk should be higher than those trusts that invest mostly in bonds, but lower than those investing mostly in stocks. As the trust's allocation between underlying funds gradually changes, the trust's overall level of risk also will decline. The trust also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the trust to underperform other trusts with a similar investment objective. Investments in Target Retirement Trusts are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the trust name refers to the approximate year 2020 when an investor in the trust would retire and leave the workforce. The trust will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in the Target Retirement Trust is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
