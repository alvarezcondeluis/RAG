## Investment objective

Vanguard Growth and Income Fund seeks to provide a total return (capital appreciation plus dividend income) greater than the return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index.

## Investment strategy

The fund's advisors use fundamental and quantitative investment approaches to select a broadly diversified group of stocks that, as a whole, have investment characteristics similar to those of the S&amp;P 500 Index, but are expected to provide a higher total return than that of the index. At least 65% (and typically more than 90%) of the fund's assets will be invested in stocks that are included in the index. Most of the stocks held by the fund provide dividend income as well as the potential for capital appreciation.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.
