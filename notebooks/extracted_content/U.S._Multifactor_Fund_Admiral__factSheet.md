## Investment objective

Vanguard U.S. Multifactor Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing in U.S. stocks which target three factors, value, momentum, and quality, after an initial volatility screen. Such a strategy offers potential diversification benefits that can help reduce the active risk associated with exposure to a single factor.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests primarily in U.S. common stocks with the potential to generate higher returns relative to the broad U.S. equity market by investing in stocks with relatively strong recent performance, strong fundamentals, and low prices relative to fundamentals as determined by the advisor. The portfolio will include a diverse mix of companies representing many different market sectors and industry groups. The advisor uses a quantitative model to evaluate all of the securities in an investment universe comprised of U.S. large, mid, and small capitalization stocks and to construct a U.S. equity portfolio that seeks to achieve exposure to multiple factors subject to a set of reasonable constraints designed to foster portfolio diversification, liquidity, and lower volatility. Under normal circumstances, typically 100% of the fund's assets will be invested in securities issued by U.S. companies.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from U.S. stock markets. Specific types of stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better or worse than other segments of the U.S. stock market. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
