## Investment objective

Vanguard Institutional 500 Index Trust seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large-capitalization stocks.

## Investment strategy

The trust portfolio currently invests all its assets in Institutional Select shares of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund which employs a 'passive management'-or indexing-investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.

An investment in the trust could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the trust's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The trust's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The trust's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Sector risk : The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the trust's assets are in the information technology sector, the trust's performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.

Nondiversification risk : Because the trust seeks to closely track the composition of the target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the trust's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the trust's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement. As a result, trust performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the trust's shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.
