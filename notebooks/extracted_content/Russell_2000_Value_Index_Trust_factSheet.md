## Investment objective

Vanguard Russell 2000 Value Index Trust seeks  to track the performance of the Russell 2000 Value Index, an unmanaged benchmark that measures the investment return of small-capitalization value stocks.

## Investment strategy

The trust seeks to track the investment performance of the Russell 2000 Value Index, an unmanaged benchmark of companies in the small-cap Russell 2000 Index with price/book ratios and forecasted growth characteristics that are lower than average. Using full replication, the portfolio holds each index stock in the same proportion as its weighting in the index. Vanguard's Equity Investment Group uses proprietary software to implement trading decisions that accommodate cash flow and maintain close correlation with the index's characteristics.

An investment in the trust portfolio could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the portfolio's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The portfolio's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Index replicating risk, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.
