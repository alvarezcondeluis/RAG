## Investment objective

Vanguard Global Capital Cycles Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in U.S. and foreign equity securities. The fund seeks to generate above average compounded returns by purchasing securities in companies and industries where capital spending is declining, and seeks to avoid companies, assets, and business models that can be easily replicated. The fund typically invests across a range of sectors, a mix of developed and emerging markets stocks, and typically holds companies across the market capitalization spectrum. The fund will concentrate its investments (i.e. hold 25% or more of its total assets) in securities of issuers in the precious metals and mining industry.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Investment style risk: the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from global stock markets. Small-, mid-, and large-capitalization stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the global stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and midsize companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Manager risk: the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Country/regional risk: the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Emerging markets risk: The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.

Currency risk: the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Industry concentration risk: the chance that there will be particular problems affecting an entire industry. Any fund that concentrates in a particular industry will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. The precious metals and mining industry could be affected by sharp price volatility caused by global economic, financial, and political factors. Resource availability, government regulation, inflation expectations and economic cycles could also adversely affect that industry.

Nondiversification risk: the chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.
