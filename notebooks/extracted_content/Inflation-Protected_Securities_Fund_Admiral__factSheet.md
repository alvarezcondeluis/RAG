## Investment objective

Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund seeks to provide investors inflation protection and income consistent with investment in inflation-indexed securities.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests at least 80% of its assets in inflation-indexed bonds issued by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and corporations. The fund may invest in bonds of any maturity; however, its dollar-weighted average maturity is expected to be in a range of 7 to 20 years. At a minimum, all bonds purchased by the fund will be rated 'investment grade' or, if unrated, will be considered by the advisor to be investment grade.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

Interest rate risk , which is the chance that the value of a bond will fluctuate because of a change in the level of interest rates. Although inflation-indexed bonds seek to provide inflation protection, their prices may decline when interest rates rise and vice versa. Because the fund's dollar-weighted average maturity is expected to be in the range of 7 to 20 years, interest rate risk is expected to be moderate to high for the fund.

Income fluctuations . The fund's quarterly income distributions are likely to fluctuate considerably more than the income distributions of a typical bond fund. In fact, under certain conditions, the fund may not have any income to distribute. Income fluctuations associated with changes in interest rates are expected to be low; however, income fluctuations associated with changes in inflation are expected to be high. Overall, investors can expect income fluctuations to be high for the fund.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Derivatives risk . The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.

While U.S. Treasury or government agency securities provide substantial protection against credit risk, they do not protect investors against price changes due to changing interest rates. Unlike stocks and bonds, U.S. Treasury bills are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest.
