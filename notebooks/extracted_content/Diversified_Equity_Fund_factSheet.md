## Investment objective

Vanguard Diversified Equity Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation and dividend income.

## Investment strategy

As a 'fund of funds,' the Diversified Equity Fund invests in a diversified group of other Vanguard equity mutual funds, rather than in individual securities. The underlying funds' holdings mainly consist of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization equity securities of domestic companies.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause one or more of the fund's actively managed underlying funds-and, thus, the fund itself-to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Asset allocation risk: The chance that the selection of underlying funds, and the allocation of a high percentage of assets to a relatively few number of underlying funds, may cause the fund to be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of any one underlying fund or to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.
