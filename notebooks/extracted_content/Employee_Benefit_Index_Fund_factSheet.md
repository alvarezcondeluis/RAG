## Investment objective

Vanguard Employee Benefit Index Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large-capitalization stocks.

## Investment strategy

The trust employs a 'passive management'-or indexing-investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The trust attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.

## Plain talk about risk

The trust is subject to several kinds of risk, so an investor could lose money over short or even extended periods. The main risks of investing in the trust are:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.
