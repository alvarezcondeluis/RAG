## Plain talk about risk

The fund is subject to several bond and stock market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because bond and stock prices can move in different directions or to different degrees, the fund's bond and short-term investment holdings may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund's stock holdings. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.

Income risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.

Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.

Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income.

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
