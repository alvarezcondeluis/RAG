## General note

The inception date for the fund's Investor Shares was September 6, 1994; Investor Shares were renamed Admiral Shares on May 13, 2011.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Tax-managed investing risk is the chance that market conditions or other circumstances may limit the fund's ability to generate tax losses or to generate dividend income taxed at favorable tax rates. The fund's tax-managed strategy may cause the fund to hold a security in order to achieve more favorable tax-treatment or to sell a security in order to create tax losses, which may impact returns. Although the fund intends to track the performance of the index, the tracking may fluctuate periodically based on the sampling of the index for tax efficiency.

## Note on frequent trading restrictions

Frequent trading policies may apply to those funds offered as investment options within your plan. Please log on to   vanguard.com for your employer plans or contact Participant Services at 800-523-1188 for additional information.

After-tax returns are calculated using the highest individual federal income tax rates in effect at the time of each distribution. They do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Your after-tax return depends on your individual tax situation and, therefore, may differ from the return presented here. If you own fund shares in a tax-deferred account such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, this information does not apply to your investment because these accounts are not subject to current taxes. After-tax returns for Vanguard funds reflect the reduced tax rates on ordinary income, qualified dividend income, and short-term and long-term capital gains that went into effect in 2003. The fund's past performance-whether before or after taxes-does not guarantee future results. If a fund incurs a loss, which generates a tax benefit, the post-liquidation after-tax return may exceed the fund's other return figures. After-tax returns are quarter-end adjusted for fees. After-tax returns for most funds are calculated using the tax liability implied by each fund's declared distributions. However, the exact tax characteristics of many distributions are not known until after the close of the calendar year.
