## Investment objective

Vanguard Ultra-Short-Term Bond Fund seeks to provide current income while maintaining limited price volatility.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in a diversified portfolio of high-quality and, to a lesser extent, medium-quality fixed income securities. High-quality fixed income securities are those rated the equivalent of A3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or another independent rating agency or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality by the advisor; medium-quality fixed income securities are those rated the equivalent of Baa1, Baa2, or Baa3 by Moody's or another independent rating agency or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality by the advisor. The fund is expected to maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity of 0 to 2 years. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in fixed income securities.

The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk, but you could still lose money by investing in it. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Income risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund's monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.

Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.

Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.

Liquidity risk: The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income.

Prepayment risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage's principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Derivatives risk. The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
