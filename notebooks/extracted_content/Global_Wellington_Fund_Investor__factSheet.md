## Investment objective

Vanguard Global Wellington Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation and moderate current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests 60% to 70% of its assets in dividend-paying and, to a lesser extent, non-dividend-paying equity securities of established large U.S. and foreign companies. In choosing these companies, the advisor seeks those that appear to be undervalued but have prospects for improvement. These stocks are commonly referred to as value stocks. The remaining 30% to 40% of the fund's assets are invested mainly in U.S. and foreign fixed income securities that the advisor believes will generate a moderate level of current income. These securities include investment-grade corporate bonds, with some exposure to government and government agency bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. The fund will also invest in local currency bonds.

## Portfolio management

## Plain talk about risk

The fund is subject to the risks associated with the U.S. and foreign stock and bond markets, any of which could cause an investor to lose money, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions. However, because stock and bond prices can move in different directions or to different degrees, the fund's bond holdings may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund's stock holdings.

Investment style risk , which is the chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Mid- and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the global stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Stock market risk , which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.

Country/regional risk , which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by governments, government agencies, or companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of governments, government agencies, or companies located in any one country or region, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.

Income risk , which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund holding bonds will experience a decline in income when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds.

Interest rate risk , which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because the fund invests only a portion of its assets in bonds and because the average duration of the fund's bond portfolio is generally intermediate-term. The prices of short- and intermediate-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.

Currency risk , which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Currency hedging risk , which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund's foreign currency exposure.

Credit risk , which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a portion of its assets in bonds, most of which are considered to be of high quality. Call risk , which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk.

Liquidity risk , which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Manager risk , which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
