1. As reported in the most recent prospectus. A fund's current expense ratio may be lower or higher than the figure reported in the prospectus.

2.   Figures for periods of less than one year are cumulative returns. All other figures represent average annual returns. Fund performance figures assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions; the figures are pre-tax and net of expenses. The above widely used comparative index represents unmanaged or average returns on various financial assets that can be compared with the fund's total returns for the purpose of measuring relative performance.

3.   As of 4 p.m., Eastern time, when the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange typically closes.

4.   Effective July 15, 2024, the market price returns are calculated using the official closing price as reported by the ETF's primary exchange. Prior to July 15, 2024, the market price returns were calculated using the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as of the closing time of the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4 p.m., Eastern time). The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

5.   Average duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond-and bond mutual fund-prices to interest rate movements. For example, if a bond has a duration of 2 years, its price would fall about 2% when interest rates rose 1 percentage point. On the other hand, the bond's price would rise by about 2% when interest rates fell by 1 percentage point.

6.   Average stated maturity represents the average of the stated maturity dates for all fixed income securities held by the fund.

7.   For most recent fiscal year. Turnover rate excludes the value of portfolio securities received or delivered as a result of in-kind purchases or redemptions of the fund's capital shares, including Vanguard ETF Creation Units.

1. Represents the expense ratio for the Vanguard ETF as reported in the most recent prospectus. There are material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are priced continuously and bought and sold throughout the day in the secondary market (at a premium or discount to net asset value) with the assistance of a stockbroker, which entails paying commissions. Sources: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company, and Vanguard, December 31, 2024.

2.  Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.

Vanguard ETF® shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy or sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.
