1.  The expense ratio information shown reflects estimated amounts for the current fiscal year.

2. Average duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond-and bond mutual fund-prices to interest rate movements. For example, if a bond has a duration of 2 years, its price would fall about 2% when interest rates rose 1 percentage point. On the other hand, the bond's price would rise by about 2% when interest rates fell by 1 percentage point.

3. Average effective maturity is defined as the average length of time until fixed income securities held by a fund are expected to be repaid, taking into consideration that an action such as a call or refunding may cause some bonds to be repaid before they mature.

1. Represents the expense ratio for the Vanguard ETF as reported in the most recent prospectus. There are material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are priced continuously and bought and sold throughout the day in the secondary market (at a premium or discount to net asset value) with the assistance of a stockbroker, which entails paying commissions. Sources: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company, and Vanguard, December 31, 2024.

2. Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.

Vanguard ETF® shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy or sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

All ETF products are subject to risk, which may result in the loss of principal. Investments  in bond ETF products are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.
