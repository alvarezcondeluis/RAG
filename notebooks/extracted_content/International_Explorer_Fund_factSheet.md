## Investment objective

Vanguard International Explorer Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests primarily in the equity securities of small-capitalization companies located outside the United States that the advisors believe offer the potential for capital appreciation. In doing so, each advisor considers, among other things, whether a company is likely to have above-average earnings growth, whether the company's securities are attractively valued, and whether the company has a sustainable competitive advantage. The fund uses multiple investment advisors. Each advisor independently selects and maintains a portfolio of common stocks for the fund.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Country/Regional risk: The chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/Regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Currency risk: The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from non-U.S. small-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, non-U.S.

small-capitalization stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Emerging markets risk: The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.
