## Investment objective

Vanguard Baillie Gifford Global Positive Impact Stock Fund seeks capital appreciation with an emphasis on investing in businesses that deliver positive change by contributing towards a more sustainable and inclusive world.

## Investment strategy

Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in stocks of companies that Baillie Gifford, the fund's advisor, determines contribute towards a more sustainable and inclusive world. The fund seeks to meet its investment objective by investing in a global portfolio of stocks of companies located in a number of countries throughout the world, including in developed, emerging, and frontier markets. The fund invests in common and preferred stocks directly, such as through trading on local stock markets around the world, and indirectly, such as through depositary receipts. The fund is not constrained with respect to market capitalization or industry allocation.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from the types of growth stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The long-term investment approach of the fund may cause the fund to lose money or underperform compared to its benchmark index or other mutual funds over extended periods of time, and the fund may not perform as expected in the long term. An investment in the fund may be more suitable for long-term investors who can bear the risk of short- or medium-term fluctuations in the value of the fund's portfolio.

Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few investments. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the instruments of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.

Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

Impact risk, which is the risk that the fund may not be successful in assessing and identifying companies that have or will have a positive impact or support a given position. In some circumstances, companies could ultimately have a negative impact, or no impact, on addressing a global challenge, or on environmental, social and/or governance matters.

Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest its assets in securities of companies located in emerging markets, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that country or region. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging and frontier markets.

Emerging and frontier markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging and frontier markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging and frontier markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.

Special risks of investing in China: The fund's investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund's holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE's market value, which in turn could impact the fund's performance.

ESG investing risks: The fund is subject to ESG investing risks. The fund's advisor selects securities for the fund based on the ESG criteria disclosed in the fund's principal investment strategies. Using ESG criteria could result in the fund investing in securities that trail the returns of other funds that use ESG criteria or in the fund underperforming the market as a whole. Interpretations of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics can - and do - vary significantly across individuals, index providers, advisors, and other funds that use ESG criteria. As a result, the fund's disclosed ESG criteria, or the advisor's assessment of whether or not a company or issuer meets the fund's disclosed ESG criteria,

may not align with your personal view of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics. Further, individual securities held by the fund may not reflect your personal preferences, beliefs, expectations, and/or values. In order to assess a company or issuer against the fund's disclosed ESG criteria, the advisor depends on the availability of data obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. There can be no assurance that this data will be accurate, complete, or current, which could result in an inaccurate assessment of a company or issuer.

Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
