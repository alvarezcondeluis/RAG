1. As reported in the most recent prospectus. A fund's current expense ratio may be lower or higher than the figure reported in the prospectus.

1. Represents the expense ratio for the Vanguard ETF as reported in the most recent prospectus. There are material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are priced continuously and bought and sold throughout the day in the secondary market (at a premium or discount to net asset value) with the assistance of a stockbroker, which entails paying commissions. Sources: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company, and Vanguard, December 31, 2024.

2.  For most recent fiscal year. Turnover rate excludes the value of portfolio securities received or delivered as a result of in-kind purchases or redemptions of the fund's capital shares, including Vanguard ETF Creation Units.

3.  A measure of the volatility of a fund-based on the fund's last three years of monthly returns-used to indicate the dispersion of past returns. A higher standard deviation means a greater potential for volatility. For funds with less than 36 months of performance history, standard deviation is not calculated.

4.  The holdings listed exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.

5.  Sector categories are based on the Industry Classification Benchmark system ('ICB'), except for the 'Other' category (if applicable), which includes securities that have not been provided an ICB classification as of the effective reporting period.

Vanguard ETF® shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy or sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

All ETF products are subject to risk, which may result in the loss of principal. Prices of mid- and small-cap ETF products often fluctuate more than those of large-cap ETF products.
