## Investment objective

Vanguard Massachusetts Tax-Exempt Fund seeks to provide a high level of current income that is exempt from both federal and Massachusetts personal income taxes. The fund is intended for Massachusetts residents only.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests primarily in high-quality municipal bonds issued by Massachusetts state and local governments, as well as by regional governmental and public financing authorities. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's assets will be invested in securities whose income is exempt from federal and Massachusetts state taxes. Although the fund has no limitations on the maturities of individual securities, its dollar-weighted average maturity is expected to be between 10 and 25 years.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. As a tax-advantaged investment, the fund is potentially vulnerable to federal and state tax-law changes. Also, part of the fund's return may consist of capital gains distributions that are taxable in the same way that realized capital gains on any investment are taxable.The fund's performance could be hurt by:

State-specific risk: The chance that developments in Massachusetts, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by Massachusetts and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in Massachusetts than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall Massachusetts municipal market.

Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.

Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.

Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income.

Extension risk: The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.

Income risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.

Liquidity risk: The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Nondiversification risk: The chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.

Tax risk: The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.

Frequent trading policies may apply to those funds offered as investment options within your plan. Please log on to   vanguard.com for your employer plans or contact Participant Services at 800-523-1188 for additional information.

Although the income from a municipal bond fund is exempt from federal tax, you may owe taxes on any capital gains realized through the fund's trading or through your own redemption of shares. For some investors, a portion of the fund's income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
