## Investment objective

Vanguard Institutional Extended Market Index Trust seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of small- and mid-capitalization stocks.

## Investment strategy

The trust portfolio currently invests all its assets in Institutional Select shares of the Vanguard Institutional Extended Market Index Fund which employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's Completion Index, a broadly diversified index of stocks of small and medium-size U.S. companies. The Standard &amp; Poor's Completion Index contains all of the U.S. common stocks regularly traded on the New York and American Stock Exchanges, and the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, except those stocks included in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index. The fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in stocks of its target index, with nearly 80% of its assets invested in the 1,200 largest stocks in its target index (covering nearly 80% of the index's total market capitalization), and the rest of its assets in a representative sample of the remaining stocks. The fund holds a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full index in terms of key characteristics. These key characteristics include industry weightings and market capitalization, as well as certain financial measures such as price/earnings ratio and dividend yield.

An investment in the trust portfolio could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the trust portfolio's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The trust portfolio's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Index sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.
