## Investment objective

Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund seeks to provide a high level of income and moderate long-term capital appreciation by tracking the performance of a benchmark index that measures the performance of publicly traded equity REITs and other real estate-related investments.

## Investment strategy

The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. The MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index is made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the real estate sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The GICS real estate sector is composed of equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs), which includes specialized REITs, and real estate management and development companies. The fund attempts to replicate the index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets-either directly or indirectly through a wholly owned subsidiary (the underlying fund), which is itself a registered investment company-in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index. The fund may invest a portion of its assets in the underlying fund.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Industry concentration risk: The chance that the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the fund concentrates its assets in real estate stocks, industry concentration risk is high.

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Interest rate risk: The chance that REIT stock prices overall will decline, and that the cost of borrowing for REITs will increase because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is high for the portfolio.

Asset concentration risk: The chance that, because the fund's target index (and therefore the fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

Investment style risk: The chance that the returns from REIT stocks-which frequently are small- or mid-capitalization stocks-will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, REIT stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market.

Nondiversification risk: The chance that the fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer or group of issuers or may own larger positions of an issuer's voting stock than a diversified fund.

Index-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.

Index replicating risk: The chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.
