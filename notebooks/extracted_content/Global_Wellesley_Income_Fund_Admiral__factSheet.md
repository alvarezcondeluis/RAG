## Investment objective

Vanguard Global Wellesley Income Fund seeks to provide long-term growth of income and a high and sustainable level of current income, along with moderate long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests approximately 60% to 70% of its assets in U.S. and foreign investment-grade fixed income securities that the advisor believes will generate a reasonable level of current income, including corporate, government, and government agency bonds, as well as mortgage-backed securities. The fund will also invest in local currency bonds. The remaining 30% to 40% of fund assets are invested in equity securities of mid- and large-size U.S. and foreign companies that have a history of above-average dividends or expectations of increasing dividends.

## Plain talk about risk

The fund is subject to the risks associated with the U.S. and foreign stock and bond markets, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because fixed income securities such as bonds usually are less volatile than stocks and because the fund invests more than half of its assets in fixed income securities, the fund's overall level of risk should be low to moderate.

With approximately 60% to 70% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign bonds the fund is proportionately subject to the following bond risks: interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates; income risk, which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates; credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline; liquidity risk, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price; and call risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign bonds: country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events - such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters - will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, or companies; currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates; and currency hedging risk, which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund's foreign currency exposure.

With approximately 30% to 40% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign equity securities, the fund is proportionately subject to the following stock risks: stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline; and investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization dividend-paying value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Mid- and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks because, among other things, mid-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign stocks. Country/regional risk is the chance that world events - such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters - will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Currency risk is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Country/regional risk and currency risk are especially high in emerging markets. The fund is also subject to manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
