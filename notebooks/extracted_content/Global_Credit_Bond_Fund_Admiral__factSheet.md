## Investment objective

Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund seeks to provide a moderate and sustainable level of current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund will invest in securities issued throughout markets, and denominated in global currencies. The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets the world, including issuers located in emerging in debt securities, primarily investing in investment-grade debt securities that the advisor believes will generate a moderate and sustainable level of current income. These debt securities include corporate and non-corporate obligations with an average rating equivalent to Baa3 and above by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or another independent rating agency or, if unrated, that the fund's advisor determines to be of comparable quality. The fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in below-investment-grade bonds. The fund will attempt to hedge most of its foreign currency exposure, primarily through the use of foreign currency exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage the currency risk associated with investing in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Call risk: the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Counterparty risk: the chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract, or other investment vehicle, with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations.

Country/regional risk: the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value or liquidity of securities issued by companies in foreign governments, government agencies, or companies. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.

Credit risk: the chance that the issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that financial asset to decline.

Currency risk: the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging market countries.

Currency hedging risk: the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund's foreign currency exposure.

Extension risk: the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall.

Income risk : the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.

Interest rate risk : the chance that fixed income prices will decline because of rising interest rates.

Liquidity risk : the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Manager risk : the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Derivatives risk , which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
