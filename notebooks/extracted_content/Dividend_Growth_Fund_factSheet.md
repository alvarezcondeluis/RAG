## Investment objective

Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund seeks to provide, primarily, a growing stream of income over time and, secondarily, long-term capital appreciation and current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests primarily in stocks that tend to offer current dividends. The fund focuses on high-quality companies that have prospects for long-term total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time. These stocks typically-but not always-will be undervalued relative to the market and will show potential for increasing dividends. The fund will be diversified across industry sectors.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from dividend-paying large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Specific types of stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.
