## Investment objective

Vanguard Materials Index Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of materials stocks.

## Investment strategy

The fund employs a 'passive management'-or indexing-investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Materials 25/50 Index, an index of stocks of large, medium-size, and small U.S. companies in the materials sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). This GICS sector is made up of companies in a wide range of commodity-related manufacturing industries. Included within this sector are companies that manufacture chemicals, construction materials, glass, paper, forest products, and related packaging products, as well as metals, minerals and mining companies, including producers of steel. The fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index. The fund may also sample its target index by holding stocks that, in the aggregate, are intended to approximate the index in terms of key characteristics, such as price/earnings ratio, earnings growth, and dividend yield. Typically, the fund will use a sampling strategy only if regulatory constraints or other considerations prevent it from replicating the index.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk : The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.

Sector risk : The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the materials sector, the fund's performance largely depends-for better or for worse-on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the materials sector could be affected by, among other things, commodity prices, government regulation, inflation expectations, resource availability, and economic cycles. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.

Nondiversification risk : The chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund's share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high for the fund.

Investment style risk : The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Index replicating risk , which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.

Index-related risks : The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.
