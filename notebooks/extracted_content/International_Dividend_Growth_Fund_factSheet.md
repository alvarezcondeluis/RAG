## Investment objective

Vanguard International Dividend Growth Fund seeks to provide, primarily, a growing stream of income over time and, secondarily, long-term capital appreciation and current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests primarily in stocks that tend to offer current dividends and are predominantly located in developed markets outside of the United States. The fund focuses on high-quality companies that have prospects for long-term total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time. These stocks typically-but not always-will be large-cap, will be undervalued relative to the market, and will show potential for increasing dividends.

## Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:

Stock market risk : The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.

Manager risk : The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investments in the consumer staples and health care sectors subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of these sectors.

Investment style risk : The chance that returns from dividend-paying, large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

Asset concentration risk : The chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.

Country/regional risk : The chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets insecurities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Currency risk : The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.
