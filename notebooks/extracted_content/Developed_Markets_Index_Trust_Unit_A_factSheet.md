## Investment objective

Vanguard Developed Markets Index Trust seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in Canada and the major markets of Europe and the Pacific region.

## Investment strategy

The trust employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index that is made up of approximately 3,700 common stocks of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies located in Canada and the major markets of Europe and the Pacific region. The trust attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the trust could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the trust's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The trust is subject to the following risks, which could affect the trust's performance:

Stock market risk , which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The trust's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the trust's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the trust to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

Country/regional risk , which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the trust may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the trust's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Significant investments in Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.) subject the Index and the fund to proportionately higher exposure to Japanese and U.K. country risk.

Investment style risk , which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Currency risk , which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Index-related risks: The trust is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the trust's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the trust's performance. Because the trust seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the trust's performance may be lower than it would be if the trust were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the trust's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the trust will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the trust and, as a result, the trust's shareholders.
