## Investment objective

Vanguard Core Bond Fund seeks to provide total return while generating a moderate level of current income.

## Investment strategy

The fund invests in fixed income securities of various maturities, yields, and qualities. Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in bonds, which include fixed income securities such as corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government and agency securities, and asset-backed, mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities. All bonds purchased by the fund will have a maturity of 90 days or more at the time of their issuance. In addition, the fund invests predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, although these bonds may be issued by a foreign corporation or a U.S. affiliate of a foreign corporation or a foreign government or its agencies and instrumentalities. The fund may also invest up to 10% of its assets in non-U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.

The fund's dollar-weighted average maturity will normally range between 4 and 12 years, and may either be longer or shorter under certain market conditions. Since the fund will have holdings in asset-backed, mortgage-backed, and similar securities, the fund's weighted average maturity may be approximate to the weighted average maturity of the cash flows in the securities held by the fund, given certain prepayment assumptions. This is also known as weighted average life.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:

Interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.

Income risk, which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund's monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.

Call risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Prepayment risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage's principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.

Extension risk, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, extension risk is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates.

Credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.

Liquidity risk, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.

Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Derivatives risk, the fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.

TBA securities risk: A TBA transaction represents an agreement to buy or sell mortgage-backed securities with agreed-upon characteristics for a fixed unit price at a future date, but does not specify the particular security to be delivered. TBA transactions involve the risk that the value of the mortgage-backed securities to be purchased declines prior to settlement date or the counterparty does not deliver the securities as promised.

† Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 'NR' is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include internal money market funds, derivatives, and futures. U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities appear under 'U.S. Government.' Credit-quality ratings for each issue are either obtained from Bloomberg using ratings derived from Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), or directly from Moody's and S&amp;P. Credit-quality ratings obtained from Bloomberg use the following methodologies: When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used; when ratings from only two of the agencies are available, the lower rating is used; and when one rating is available, that rating is used. Credit-quality ratings obtained directly from Moody's and S&amp;P use the higher rating for each issue.
