## Investment strategy

The trust portfolio employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index designed to measure equity market performance of companies located in developed and emerging markets,

free-float-adjusted excluding the United States. The index includes more than 5,300 stocks of companies located in 46 countries. The trust invests substantially all of its assets in the common stocks included in its target index.

An investment in the trust portfolio could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the trust portfolio's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The trust portfolio's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

Country/regional risk: The chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.

Currency risk: The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization stocks, to the extent that the fund invests in them, will trail returns from the overall stock market.

Historically, these stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Emerging markets risk: The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.

Index-related risks: The trust is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the trust's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the trust's performance. Because the trust seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the trust's performance may be lower than it would be if the trust were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the trust's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the trust will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the trust and, as a result, the trust's shareholders.
