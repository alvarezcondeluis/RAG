## Investment objective

Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.

## Investment strategy

The fund uses a multimanager approach that provides exposure to a broad universe of mid-cap growth stocks. Each advisor independently manages its portion of fund assets, using its own research and investment methods. Both advisors use fundamental, bottom-up stock selection to analyze and identify companies that they believe have outstanding management and catalysts for growth, such as new products, market-share gains, and improving cost structure. Both advisors look for strong earnings-per-share growth and proven and sustainable competitive advantages.

## Connect with Vanguard   ® ·    vanguard.com Plain talk about risk

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. Investment style risk: The chance that returns from mid-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Mid-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility than large-cap stocks because, among other things, medium-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
