This fund aims to track a high-dividend yield index, which typically means it focuses on stocks that pay regular dividends. The fund's low expense ratio of 0.08% and its focus on dividend-paying stocks make it cost-effective and potentially attractive for those seeking regular income from their investments. However, it is important to note that while the fund may provide consistent income through dividends, there are risks associated with stock market volatility and potential underperformance compared to the overall stock market.\n",
