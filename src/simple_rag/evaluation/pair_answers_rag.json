The fund's asset allocation will become more conservative over time, meaning that the percentage of assets allocated to stocks will decrease while the percentage of assets allocated to bonds and other fixed income investments will increase. Within seven years after 2050, the fund's asset allocation should become similar to that of the Target Retirement Income Fund. The underlying funds are: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund.\n\nThe fund's indirect bond holdings are a diversified mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; inflation-protected public obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government, agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize foreign currency exposure).

Because the fund does not hold all of the securities included in the index, it is subject to the risk that the  representative sample of securities selected by the advisor will, in the aggregate, vary from the investment profile of the full index. Additionally, the performance of the fund's  investments, in the aggregate, may not match the investment performance of the index.

The fund also could be negatively impacted by changes to the index made by the index provider or by errors made by the index  provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders. Index Concentration risk: Except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its index, the fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose  principal business activities are in the same industry or group of industries. If the index becomes concentrated and the fund needs to concentrate in the same industry or group of  industries, its performance could be negatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated. Nondiversification risk: By tracking its broad-based index, the fund may become nondiversified as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index  rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified funds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers than diversified funds, which means their performance  may be negatively impacted by relatively few stocks or even a single stock and their shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.\n\nFrequent trading policies may apply to those funds offered as investment options within your plan.

They do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Your after-tax return depends on your individual tax situation and, therefore, may differ from the return presented here. If you own fund shares in a taxdeferred account such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, this information does not apply to your investment because these accounts are not subject to current taxes. After-tax returns for Vanguard funds reflect the reduced tax rates on ordinary income, qualified dividend income, and short-term and long-term capital gains that went into effect in 2003. The fund's past performance-whether before or after taxes-does not guarantee future results. If a fund incurs a loss, which generates a tax benefit, the post-liquidation after-tax return may exceed the fund's other return figures. After-tax returns are quarter-end adjusted for fees. After-tax returns for most funds are calculated using the tax liability implied by each fund's declared distributions. However, the exact tax characteristics of many distributions are not known until after the close of the calendar year.\n\nThe Russell Indexes and Russell® are registered trademarks of Russell Investments and have been licensed for use by The Vanguard Group, Inc.

You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. Because of the fund's emphasis on low-dividend stocks and its policy of realizing losses to help offset capital gains, its performance will  periodically deviate from that of the Russell 1000 Index.

The fund's tax-managed strategy may cause the fund to hold a security in order to achieve more favorable tax-treatment or to sell a security in order to create  tax losses, which may impact returns.

You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:\n\nStock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.\n\nEmerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.\n\nCountry/regional risk, which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.\n\nSpecial risks of investing in China: The fund's investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund's holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE's market value, which in turn could impact the fund's performance.\n\nCurrency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.\n\nInvestment style risk, which is the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from global stock markets. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better-or worse-than other segments of the stock market or the global market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.\n\nManager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the financial sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.",

The fund's target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.\n\nSector risk : The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the consumer discretionary sector, the fund's performance largely depends-for better or for worse-on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, interest rates, consumer confidence, and disposable income. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.\n\nNondiversification risk : The chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund's share price.

Interest rate risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in short-term bonds, whose prices are much less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.\n\nIncome risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.\n\nCall risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate.\n\nCredit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.\n\nIndex sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.\n\nIndex-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider.

You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. As a tax-advantaged investment, the fund is potentially vulnerable to federal and state tax-law changes. Also, part of the fund's return may consist of capital gains distributions that are taxable in the same way that realized capital gains on any investment are taxable. The fund's performance could be hurt by:\n\nState-specific risk: The chance that developments in Pennsylvania, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by Pennsylvania and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in Pennsylvania than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall Pennsylvania municipal market.\n\nCredit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.\n\nInterest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.\n\nCall risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund's income.\n\nExtension risk: The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.\n\nIncome risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.\n\nLiquidity risk: The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.\n\nManager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.\n\nNondiversification risk: The chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.\n\nTax risk: The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.",

Because the fund does not hold all of the securities included in the index, it is subject to the risk that the  representative sample of securities selected by the advisor will, in the aggregate, vary from the investment profile of the full index. Additionally, the performance of the fund's  investments, in the aggregate, may not match the investment performance of the index. This risk, known as tracking error risk, may be heightened during times of increased market  volatility or under other unusual market conditions. The fund also could be negatively impacted by changes to the index made by the index provider or by errors made by the index  provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders. Index Concentration risk: Except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its index, the fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose  principal business activities are in the same industry or group of industries. If the index becomes concentrated and the fund needs to concentrate in the same industry or group of  industries, its performance could be negatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated. Nondiversification risk: By tracking its broad-based index, the fund may become nondiversified as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index  rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified funds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers than diversified funds, which means their performance  may be negatively impacted by relatively few stocks or even a single stock and their shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.\n\nFrequent trading policies may apply to those funds offered as investment options within your plan.

If you own fund shares in a taxdeferred account such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, this information does not apply to your investment because these accounts are not subject to current taxes. After-tax returns for Vanguard funds reflect the reduced tax rates on ordinary income, qualified dividend income, and short-term and long-term capital gains that went into effect in 2003.

    "answer": "According to the \"Inception date\" (02/07/19) and the growth data for different periods ending on December 31, 2024, we can see that there are three available options: \n\n- January 31, 2015 - December 31, 2024\n- August 31, 2015 - December 31, 2024 \n- February 28, 2019 - December 31, 2024\n\nSince the inception date is February 7, 2019, we can only use the last option to calculate the growth of a $10,000 investment.\n\nSo, as of December 31, 2024, a $10,000 investment in VHYAX would be worth:\n\n$14,523MM \n\nHowever, this figure seems incorrect for an answer. This is likely because it's displaying the total net assets rather than the value of a single $10,000 investment.\n\nWe can see that the growth data shows a 4-year growth from February 28, 2019 to December 31, 2024: \n\n$14,523MM -> We don't know the exact breakdown but we have other periods' data.\n\nHowever, we can calculate the total growth from inception (February 7, 2019) to December 31, 2024 using the \"Growth of a $10,000 investment\" for February 28, 2019 - December 31, 2024 which is not provided but let's analyze other periods:\n\nUsing January 31, 2015- December 31, 2024 data: The growth is $15,256 \n\nSince the inception date is after January 31, 2015 (inception year), we can't use this period. \n\nNow using August 31, 2015 - December 31, 2024 data: The growth is $12,304.\n\nWe still don't have enough information from February 28, 2019 to December 31, 2024 directly but let's try to find the right answer. If we take the inception date as February 7, 2019 and calculate the growth from that point of time we can use any one of these three periods.\n\nHowever, since we don't have direct information about the period starting on the exact inception date (February 7, 2019) let's assume it is close enough to be considered in the same range as February 28, 2019. \n\nIf a $10,000 investment becomes $14,523MM then its growth rate must be very high.",

      "## Note on frequent trading restrictions\n\nIndexing risks. The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing. Because the fund does not hold all of the securities included in the index, it is subject to the risk that the  representative sample of securities selected by the advisor will, in the aggregate, vary from the investment profile of the full index. Additionally, the performance of the fund's  investments, in the aggregate, may not match the investment performance of the index. This risk, known as tracking error risk, may be heightened during times of increased market  volatility or under other unusual market conditions. The fund also could be negatively impacted by changes to the index made by the index provider or by errors made by the index  provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders. Index Concentration risk: Except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its index, the fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose  principal business activities are in the same industry or group of industries. If the index becomes concentrated and the fund needs to concentrate in the same industry or group of  industries, its performance could be negatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated. Nondiversification risk: By tracking its broad-based index, the fund may become nondiversified as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 solely as a result of an index  rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified funds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers than diversified funds, which means their performance  may be negatively impacted by relatively few stocks or even a single stock and their shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.\n\nFrequent trading policies may apply to those funds offered as investment options within your plan. Please log on to   vanguard.com for your employer plans or contact Participant Services at 800-523-1188 for additional information.\n\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the highest individual federal income tax rates in effect at the time of each distribution. They do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Your after-tax return depends on your individual tax situation and, therefore, may differ from the return presented here. If you own fund shares in a taxdeferred account such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, this information does not apply to your investment because these accounts are not subject to current taxes. After-tax returns for Vanguard funds reflect the reduced tax rates on ordinary income, qualified dividend income, and short-term and long-term capital gains that went into effect in 2003. The fund's past performance-whether before or after taxes-does not guarantee future results. If a fund incurs a loss, which generates a tax benefit, the post-liquidation after-tax return may exceed the fund's other return figures. After-tax returns are quarter-end adjusted for fees. After-tax returns for most funds are calculated using the tax liability implied by each fund's declared distributions. However, the exact tax characteristics of many distributions are not known until after the close of the calendar year.\n\nThe Russell Indexes and Russell® are registered trademarks of Russell Investments and have been licensed for use by The Vanguard Group, Inc.

      "## Investment strategy\n\nThe fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the S&amp;P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index, which measures the performance of the investment-grade segment of the U.S. municipal bond market. The index includes municipal bonds from issuers that are primarily state or local governments or agencies whose interest is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). To be eligible for inclusion in the index, each bond must have a rating of at least investment-grade, as determined by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (e.g., at least BBB- by Fitch Ratings, Inc.); be denominated in U.S. dollars; and have a minimum par amount of $25 million. In addition, to be included in the index, each bond must have a minimum term to maturity and/or pre-funded or call date greater than one calendar month. The fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximate the full index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. All of the fund's investments will be selected through the sampling process, and at least 80% of the fund's assets will be invested in bonds held in the index. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's income will be exempt from federal income taxes.\n\n* Partial return since fund started, August 25, 2015.",
      "## Plain talk about risk\n\nAn investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. The fund's performance could be hurt by:\n\nInterest rate risk: The chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are much more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of short-term bonds.\n\nCredit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.\n\nIncome risk: The chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates.\n\nLiquidity risk: The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.\n\nIndex sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.\n\nIndex-related risks: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions.

      "## Investment strategy\n\nThe fund invests in other Vanguard mutual funds according to an asset allocation strategy designed for investors planning to retire and leave the workforce in or within a few years of 2050 (the target year). The fund's asset allocation will become more conservative over time, meaning that the percentage of assets allocated to stocks will decrease while the percentage of assets allocated to bonds and other fixed income investments will increase. Within seven years after 2050, the fund's asset allocation should become similar to that of the Target Retirement Income Fund. The underlying funds are: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund.\n\nThe fund's indirect bond holdings are a diversified mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; inflation-protected public obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government, agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize foreign currency exposure).
